v1.4.0 Release Notes (not released yet)
=======================================

See the
[release](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/releases/tag/v1.4.0) and
closed tickets on the [v1.4.0
milestone](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/milestone/8) on Github.

Required changes to existing data:
----------------------------------

Every ontology must now have the property
`knora-base:attachedToProject`, which points to the IRI of the project
that is responsible for the ontology. This must be added to each
project-specific ontology in existing repositories. All built-in
ontologies have been updated to have this property, and must therefore
be reloaded into existing repositories.

The property `knora-base:projectOntology` has been removed, and must be
removed from project definitions in existing repositories.

New features:
-------------

-   A project-specific ontology can now be deleted via API v2.
-   Added OpenAPI / Swagger API documentation route

Bugfixes:
---------

-   API v1 extended search was not properly handling multiple conditions
    on list values (issue \#800)
-   Fix image orientation in SALSAH 1 (issue \#726)
