# The DSP APIs

The DSP APIs include:

* The DSP API versions [1](api-v1/index.md) and [2](api-v2/index.md), which is intended to be used by
  virtual research environments and other clients for querying and updating
  data.
* The DSP [Admin API](api-admin/index.md), which is intended to be used only by the
  [DSP-APP](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/dsp-app) user interface, for
  administering projects that use Knora as well as Knora itself.
* The DSP [Util API](api-util/index.md), which is intended to be used for information retrieval
  about the DSP-stack itself.

DSP API v2 and the admin API support [Feature Toggles](feature-toggles.md).
