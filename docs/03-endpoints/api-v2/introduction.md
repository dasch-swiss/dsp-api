# Introduction: Using API v2

## API v2 Path Segment

Every request to API v2 includes `v2` as a path segment, e.g.
`http://host/v2/resources/http%3A%2F%2Frdfh.ch%2Fc5058f3a`.
Accordingly, requests using any other version of the API will require
another path segment.

## Response Formats

All API v2 responses can be returned in
[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/),
[Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/),
or [RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/), using
[HTTP content negotiation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.2). The client
can request these formats using the following MIME types:

| Format  | MIME Type             |
|---------|-----------------------|
| JSON-LD | `application/ld+json` |
| Turtle  | `text/turtle`         |
| RDF/XML | `application/rdf+xml` |

## JSON-LD

Our preferred format for data exchange is
[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/). JSON-LD allows the
DSP-API server to provide responses that are relatively easy for
automated processes to interpret, since their structure and semantics is
explicitly defined. For example, each user-created Knora resource
property is identified by an IRI, which can be dereferenced to get more
information about it (e.g. its label in different languages). Moreover,
each value has a type represented by an IRI. These are either standard
RDF types (e.g. XSD datatypes) or more complex types whose IRIs can be
dereferenced to get more information about their structure.

At the same time, JSON-LD responses are relatively easy for software
developers to work with, and are more concise and easier to read than
the equivalent XML. Items in a response can have human-readable names,
which can nevertheless be expanded to full IRIs. Also, while a format such as
[Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) just provides a
set of RDF triples, an equivalent JSON-LD response can explicitly
provide data in a hierarchical structure, with objects nested inside
other objects.

### Hierarchical vs. Flat JSON-LD

The client can choose between hierarchical and flat JSON-LD. In hierarchical
JSON-LD, entities with IRIs are inlined (nested) where they are used. If the
same entity is used in more than one place, it is inlined only once, and other
uses just refer to its IRI. In Knora's flat JSON-LD, all entities with IRIs are located
at the top level of the document (in a `@graph` if there is more than one of them).
This setting does not affect blank nodes, which are always inlined (unlike in standard
flat JSON-LD). DSP ontologies are always returned in the `flat` rendering; other kinds
of responses default to `hierarchical`. To use this setting, submit the HTTP header
`X-Knora-JSON-LD-Rendering` with the value `hierarchical` or `flat`.

## Knora IRIs

Resources and entities are identified by IRIs. The format of these IRIs
is explained in [Knora IRIs](knora-iris.md).

## API Schema

DSP-API v2 uses RDF data structures that are simpler than the ones
actually stored in the triplestore, and more suitable for the development
of client software. Thus we refer to the *internal* schema of data
as it is stored in the triplestore, and to *external* schemas which
are used to represent that data in API v2.

DSP-API v2 offers a complex schema and a simple one. The main difference
is that the complex schema exposes the complexity of value objects, while
the simple version does not. A client that needs to edit values must use the
complex schema in order to obtain the IRI of each value. A client that reads
but does not update data can use the simplified schema. The simple schema is
mainly intended to facilitate interoperability with other RDF-based systems in the
context of Linked Open Data. It is therefore designed to use the
simplest possible datatypes and to require minimal knowledge of Knora.

In either case, the client deals only with data whose structure and
semantics are defined by external DSP-API ontologies, which are distinct from
the internal ontologies that are used to store date in the triplestore. The Knora
API server automatically converts back and forth between these internal
and external representations. This approach encapsulates the internals
and adds a layer of abstraction to them.

IRIs representing ontologies and ontology entities are different in different
schemas; see [Knora IRIs](knora-iris.md).

Some API operations inherently require the client to accept responses in
the complex schema. For example, if an ontology is requested using an IRI
indicating the simple schema, the ontology will be returned in the simple schema (see
[Querying, Creating, and Updating Ontologies](ontology-information.md)).

Other API operations can return data in either schema. In this case, the
complex schema is used by default in the response, unless the request specifically
asks for the simple schema. The client can specify the desired schema by using
an HTTP header or a URL parameter:

- the HTTP header `X-Knora-Accept-Schema`
- the URL parameter `schema`

Both the HTTP header and the URL parameter accept the values `simple` or
`complex`.
