# Authentication

Certain routes are secured and require authentication.
When accessing any secured route an Access Token must be sent
in the HTTP authorization header with the [HTTP bearer scheme](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2.1).

Any other method of authentication is deprecated.

## Access Token / Login and Logout

A client can obtain an *access token* by sending a POST request (e.g., `{"identifier_type":"identifier_value",
"password":"password_value"}`) to the **/v2/authentication** route with
*identifier* and *password* in the body. The `identifier_type` can be `iri`, `email`, or `username`.
If the credentials are valid, a [JSON WEB Token](https://jwt.io) (JWT) will be sent back in the
response (e.g., `{"token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJ..."}`). Additionally, for web browser clients a session cookie
containing the JWT token is also created, containing `KnoraAuthentication=eyJ0eXAiOiJ...`.

To **logout**, the client sends a DELETE request to the same route **/v2/authentication** 
along with the *access token*. This will invalidate the access token,
thus not allowing further request that would supply the invalidated token.

## Checking Credentials

To check the credentials, send a GET request to **/v2/authentication** with the credentials
supplied as URL parameters or HTTP authentication headers as described before.
