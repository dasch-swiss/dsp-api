# The Sipi Media Server

[Sipi](https://sipi.io/) is a high-performance media server written in C++,
for serving and converting binary media files such as images and video. Sipi can
efficiently convert between many different formats on demand, preserving
embedded metadata, and implements the [International Image
Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](http://iiif.io/). DSP-API is designed
to use Sipi for converting and serving media files.
