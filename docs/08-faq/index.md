# Frequently Asked Questions

## File Formats

### What file formats does Knora store?

See [File Formats in Knora](../01-introduction/file-formats.md).

### Does Knora store XML files?

XML files do not lend themselves to searching and linking. Knora's RDF storage
is better suited to its goal of facilitating data reuse.

If your XML files represent text with markup (e.g. [TEI/XML](http://www.tei-c.org/)),
the recommended approach is to allow Knora to store it as
[Standoff/RDF](../01-introduction/standoff-rdf.md). This will allow both text and
markup to be searched using [Gravsearch](../03-endpoints/api-v2/query-language.md). Knora
can also regenerate, at any time, an XML document that is equivalent to the original one.

If you have XML that simply represents structured data (rather than text documents),
we recommend converting it to Knora resources, which are stored as RDF.

## Triplestores

### Which triplestores can be used with DSP-API?

DSP-API is tested with [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/).

## DSP Ontologies

### Can a project use classes or properties defined in another project's ontology?

DSP-API does not allow this to be done with project-specific ontologies.
Each project must be free to change its own ontologies, but this is not possible
if they have been used in ontologies or data created by other projects.

However, an ontology can be defined as shared, meaning that it can be used by multiple
projects, and that its creators promise not to change it in ways that could
affect other ontologies or data that are based on it. See
[Shared Ontologies](../02-dsp-ontologies/introduction.md#shared-ontologies) for details.

### Why doesn't DSP-API use `rdfs:domain` and `rdfs:range` for consistency checking?

DSP-API's consistency checking uses specific properties, which are called
`knora-base:subjectClassConstraint` and `knora-base:objectClassConstraint` in
the `knora-base` ontology, and `knora-api:subjectType` and `knora-api:objectType`
in the `knora-api` ontologies. These properties express *restrictions* on the
possible subjects and objects of a property. If a property's subject or object
does not conform to the specified restrictions, DSP-API considers it an error.

In contrast,
[the RDF Schema specification says](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domainrange)
that `rdfs:domain` and `rdfs:range` can be used to "infer additional information"
about the subjects and objects of properties, rather than to enforce restrictions.
This is, in fact, what RDFS reasoners do in practice. For example, consider these
statements:

```
example:hasAuthor rdfs:range example:Person .
data:book1 example:hasAuthor data:oxygen .
```

To an RDFS reasoner, the first statement means: if something is used as
the object of `example:hasAuthor`, we can infer that it's an
`example:Person`.

The second statement is a mistake; oxygen is not a person. But
an RDFS reasoner would infer that `data:oxygen` is actually an
`example:Person`, since it is used as the object of
`example:hasAuthor`. Queries looking for persons would then get
`data:oxygen` in their results, which would be incorrect.

Therefore, `rdfs:domain` and `rdfs:range` are not suitable for consistency
checking.

DSP-API therefore uses its own properties, along with
OWL cardinalities, which it interprets according to a "closed world"
assumption. DSP-API performs its own consistency checks to enforce
these restrictions. DSP-API repositories can also take advantage of
triplestore-specific consistency checking mechanisms.

The constraint language [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) may someday
provide a standard, triplestore-independent way to implement consistency
checks, if the obstacles to its adoption can be overcome
(see [Diverging views of SHACL](https://research.nuance.com/diverging-views-of-shacl/)).
For further discussion of these issues, see
[SHACL and OWL Compared](http://spinrdf.org/shacl-and-owl.html).

### Can a user-created property be an `owl:TransitiveProperty`?

No, because in DSP-API, a resource controls its properties. This basic
assumption is what allows DSP-API to enforce permissions and transaction
integrity. The concept of a transitive property would break this assumption.

Consider a link property `hasLinkToFoo` that is defined as an `owl:TransitiveProperty`,
and is used to link resource `Foo1` to resource `Foo2`:

![Figure 1](faq-fig1.dot.png "Figure 1")

Suppose that `Foo1` and `Foo2` are owned by different users, and that
the owner of `Foo2` does not have permission to change `Foo1`.
Now suppose that the owner of `Foo2` adds a link from `Foo2` to `Foo3`,
using the transitive property:

![Figure 2](faq-fig2.dot.png "Figure 2")

Since the property is transitive, a link from `Foo1` to `Foo3` is now
inferred. But this should not be allowed, because the owner of `Foo2`
does not have permission to add a link to `Foo1`.

Moreover, even if the owner of `Foo2` did have that permission, the inferred
link would not have a `knora-base:LinkValue` (a reification), which every
link must have. The `LinkValue` is what stores metadata about the creator
of the link, its creation date, its permissions, and so on
(see [LinkValue](../02-dsp-ontologies/knora-base.md#linkvalue)).

Finally, if an update to a resource could modify another
resource, this would violate DSP-API's model of transaction integrity, in which
each transaction can modify only one resource
(see [Application-level Locking](../05-internals/design/principles/triplestore-updates.md#application-level-locking)).
DSP-API would then be unable to ensure that concurrent transactions do not
interfere with each other.

## General

### Why should I use `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost` when running the DSP stack locally?

When running locally with the default configuration, if you want authorization cookies
to be shared between `webapi` and `sipi`, then both `webapi` and `sipi` must be accessed
over `0.0.0.0`, or otherwise, the cookie will not be sent to `sipi`.

If no authorization cookie sharing is necessary, then both `0.0.0.0` and `localhost`will
work.
