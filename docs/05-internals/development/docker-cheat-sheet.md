# Docker Cheat Sheet

A complete cheat sheet can be found
[here](https://github.com/wsargent/docker-cheat-sheet)

## Lifecycle

- [docker create](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/create)
  creates a container but does not start it.
- [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run)
  creates and starts a container in one operation.
- [docker rename](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rename/)
  allows the container to be renamed.
- [docker rm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rm)
  deletes a container.
- [docker update](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/update/)
  updates a container's resource limits.

If you want a transient container, `docker run --rm` will remove the
container after it stops.

If you want to map a directory on the host to a docker container,
`docker run -v $HOSTDIR:$DOCKERDIR`.

## Starting and Stopping

- [docker start](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/start)
  starts a container so it is running.
- [docker stop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop) stops a
  running container.
- [docker restart](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/restart)
  stops and starts a container.
- [docker pause](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pause/)
  pauses a running container, "freezing" it in place.
- [docker attach](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach)
  will connect to a running container.

## Info

- [docker ps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps)
  shows running containers.
- [docker logs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs) gets
  logs from container. (You can use a custom log driver, but logs is
  only available for json-file and journald in 1.10)
- [docker inspect](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/inspect)
  looks at all the info on a container (including IP address).
- [docker events](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events)
  gets events from container.
- [docker port](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/port) shows
  public facing port of container.
- [docker top](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/top)
  shows running processes in container.
- [docker stats](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stats) shows
  containers' resource usage statistics.
- [docker diff](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/diff) shows
  changed files in the container's FS.

`docker ps -a` shows running and stopped containers.

`docker stats --all` shows a running list of containers.

## Executing Commands

- [docker exec](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec) to
  execute a command in container.

To enter a running container, attach a new shell process to a running
container called foo, use: `docker exec -it foo /bin/bash`.

## Images

- [docker images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images) shows all images.
- [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build) creates image from Dockerfile.
