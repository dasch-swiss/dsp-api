# Consistency Checking

**Attention!** GraphDB is not supported anymore, therefore parts related 
to it in this document are redundant.

## Requirements

Knora is designed to prevent inconsistencies in RDF data,
as far as is practical, in a triplestore-independent way (see
[Triplestore Updates](triplestore-updates.md)). However, it is also
useful to enforce consistency constraints in the triplestore itself, for
two reasons:

1. To prevent inconsistencies resulting from bugs in the DSP-API server.
2. To prevent users from inserting inconsistent data directly into the triplestore, bypassing Knora.

The design of the `knora-base` ontology supports two ways of specifying
constraints on data (see [knora-base: Consistency Checking](../../../02-dsp-ontologies/knora-base.md#consistency-checking)
for details):

1. A property definition should specify the types that are allowed as
  subjects and objects of the property, using
  `knora-base:subjectClassConstraint` and (if it is an object
  property) `knora-base:objectClassConstraint`. Every subproperty of
  `knora-base:hasValue` or a `knora-base:hasLinkTo` (i.e. every
  property of a resource that points to a `knora-base:Value` or to
  another resource) is required have this constraint, because the
  DSP-API server relies on it to know what type of object to expect
  for the property. Use of `knora-base:subjectClassConstraint` is
  recommended but not required.
2. A class definition should use OWL cardinalities 
  (see [OWL 2 Quick Reference Guide](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-quick-reference/))
  to indicate the properties that instances of the class are allowed to
  have, and to constrain the number of objects that each property can
  have. Subclasses of `knora-base:Resource` are required to have a
  cardinality for each subproperty of `knora-base:hasValue` or a
  `knora-base:hasLinkTo` that resources of that class can have.

Specifically, consistency checking should prevent the following:

- An object property or datatype property has a subject of the wrong
  class, or an object property has an object of the wrong class
  (GraphDB's consistency checke cannot check the types of literals).
- An object property has an object that does not exist (i.e. the
  object is an IRI that is not used as the subject of any statements
  in the repository). This can be treated as if the object is of the
  wrong type (i.e. it can cause a violation of
  `knora-base:objectClassConstraint`, because there is no compatible
  `rdf:type` statement for the object).
- A class has `owl:cardinality 1` or `owl:minCardinality 1` on an
  object property or datatype property, and an instance of the class
  does not have that property.
- A class has `owl:cardinality 1` or `owl:maxCardinality 1` on an
  object property or datatype property, and an instance of the class
  has more than one object for that property.
- An instance of `knora-base:Resource` has an object property pointing
  to a `knora-base:Value` or to another `Resource`, and its class has
  no cardinality for that property.
- An instance of `knora-base:Value` has a subproperty of
  `knora-base:valueHas`, and its class has no cardinality for that
  property.
- A datatype property has an empty string as an object.

Cardinalities in base classes are inherited by derived classes. Derived
classes can override inherited cardinalities by making them more
restrictive, i.e. by specifying a subproperty of the one specified in
the original cardinality.

Instances of `Resource` and `Value` can be marked as deleted, using the
property `isDeleted`. This must be taken into account as follows:

- With `owl:cardinality 1` or `owl:maxCardinality 1`, if the object of
  the property can be marked as deleted, the property must not have
  more than one object that has not been marked as deleted. In other
  words, it's OK if there is more than one object, as long only one of
  them has `knora-base:isDeleted false`.
- With `owl:cardinality 1` or `owl:minCardinality 1`, the property
  must have an object, but it's OK if the property's only object is
  marked as deleted. We allow this because the subject and object may
  have different owners, and it may not be feasible for them to
  coordinate their work. The owner of the object should always be able
  to mark it as deleted. (It could be useful to notify the owner of
  the subject when this happens, but that is beyond the scope of
  consistency checking.)

## Design

[Ontotext GraphDB](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/) provides a
mechanism for checking the consistency of data in a repository each time
an update transaction is committed. Knora provides GraphDB-specific
consistency rules that take advantage of this feature to provide an
extra layer of consistency checks, in addition to the checks that are
implemented in Knora.

When a repository is created in GraphDB, a set of consistency rules can
be provided, and GraphDB's consistency checker can be turned on to
ensure that each update transaction respects these rules, as described
in the section
[Reasoning](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/11.0/reasoning.html)
of the GraphDB documentation. Like custom inference rules, consistency
rules are defined in files with the `.pie` filename extension, in a
GraphDB-specific syntax.

We have added rules to the standard RDFS inference rules file
`builtin_RdfsRules.pie`, to create the file `KnoraRules.pie`. The `.ttl`
configuration file that is used to create the repository must contain
these settings:

```
owlim:ruleset "/path/to/KnoraRules.pie" ;
owlim:check-for-inconsistencies "true" ;
```

The path to `KnoraRules.pie` must be an absolute path. The scripts
provided with Knora to create test repositories set this path
automatically.

Consistency checking in GraphDB relies on reasoning. GraphDB's reasoning
is
[Forward-chaining](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/11.0/introduction-to-semantic-web.html#reasoning-strategies),
which means that reasoning is applied to the contents of each update,
before the update transaction is committed, and the inferred statements
are added to the repository.

A GraphDB rules file can contain two types of rules: inference rules and
consistency rules. Before committing an update transaction, GraphDB
applies inference rules, then consistency rules. If any of the
consistency rules are violated, the transaction is rolled back.

An inference rule has this form:

```
Id: <rule_name>
    <premises> <optional_constraints>
    -------------------------------
    <consequences> <optional_constraints>
```

The premises are a pattern that tries to match statements found in the
data. Optional constraints, which are enclosed in square brackets, make
it possible to specify the premises more precisely, or to specify a
named graph (see examples below). Consequences are the statements that
will be inferred if the premises match. A line of hyphens separates
premises from consequences.

A GraphDB consistency rule has a similar form:

```
Consistency: <rule_name>
    <premises> <optional_constraints>
    -------------------------------
    <consequences> <optional_constraints>
```

The differences between inference rules and consistency rules are:

- A consistency rule begins with `Consistency` instead of `Id`.
- In a consistency rule, the consequences are optional. Instead of
  representing statements to be inferred, they represent statements
  that must exist if the premises are satisfied. In other words, if
  the premises are satisfied and the consequences are not found, the
  rule is violated.
- If a consistency rule doesn't specify any consequences, and the
  premises are satisfied, the rule is violated.

Rules use variable names for subjects, predicates, and objects, and they
can use actual property names.

### Empty string as object

If subject `i` has a predicate `p` whose object is an empty string, the
constraint is violated:

```
Consistency: empty_string
    i p ""
    ------------------------------------
```

### Subject and object class constraints

If subject `i` has a predicate `p` that requires a subject of type `t`,
and `i` is not a `t`, the constraint is violated:

```
Consistency: subject_class_constraint
    p <knora-base:subjectClassConstraint> t
    i p j
    ------------------------------------
    i <rdf:type> t
```

If subject `i` has a predicate `p` that requires an object of type `t`,
and the object of `p` is not a `t`, the constraint is violated:

```
Consistency: object_class_constraint
    p <knora-base:objectClassConstraint> t
    i p j
    ------------------------------------
    j <rdf:type> t
```

### Cardinality constraints

A simple implementation of a consistency rule to check
`owl:maxCardinality 1`, for objects that can be marked as deleted, could
look like this:

```
Consistency: max_cardinality_1_with_deletion_flag
    i <rdf:type> r
    r <owl:maxCardinality> "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger
    r <owl:onProperty> p
    i p j
    i p k [Constraint j != k]
    j <knora-base:isDeleted> "false"^^xsd:boolean
    k <knora-base:isDeleted> "false"^^xsd:boolean
    ------------------------------------
```

This means: if resource `i` is a subclass of an `owl:Restriction` `r`
with `owl:maxCardinality 1` on property `p`, and the resource has two
different objects for that property, neither of which is marked as
deleted, the rule is violated. Note that this takes advantage of the
fact that `Resource` and `Value` have `owl:cardinality 1` on `isDeleted`
(`isDeleted` must be present even if false), so we do not need to check
whether `i` is actually something that can be marked as deleted.

However, this implementation would be much too slow. We therefore use
two optimisations suggested by Ontotext:

1. Add custom inference rules to make tables (i.e. named graphs) of
   pre-calculated information about the cardinalities on properties of
   subjects, and use those tables to simplify the consistency rules.
2. Use the `[Cut]` constraint to avoid generating certain redundant
   compiled rules (see [Entailment
   rules](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/11.0/reasoning.html#entailment-rules)).

For example, to construct a table of subjects belonging to classes that
have `owl:maxCardinality 1` on some property `p`, we use the following
custom inference rule:

```
Id: maxCardinality_1_table
    i <rdf:type> r
    r <owl:maxCardinality> "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger
    r <owl:onProperty> p
    ------------------------------------
    i p r [Context <onto:_maxCardinality_1_table>]
```

The constraint `[Context <onto:_maxCardinality_1_table>]` means that the
inferred triples are added to the context (i.e. the named graph)
`http://www.ontotext.com/_maxCardinality_1_table`. (Note that we have
defined the prefix `onto` as `http://www.ontotext.com/` in the
`Prefices` section of the rules file.) As the GraphDB documentation on
[Rules](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/11.0/reasoning.html#rules)
explains:

> If the context is provided, the statements produced as rule
> consequences are not ‘visible’ during normal query answering. Instead,
> they can only be used as input to this or other rules and only when
> the rule premise explicitly uses the given context.

Now, to find out whether a subject belongs to a class with that
cardinality on a given property, we only need to match one triple. The
revised implementation of the rule
`max_cardinality_1_with_deletion_flag` is as follows:

```
Consistency: max_cardinality_1_with_deletion_flag
    i p r [Context <onto:_maxCardinality_1_table>]
    i p j [Constraint j != k]
    i p k [Cut]
    j <knora-base:isDeleted> "false"^^xsd:boolean
    k <knora-base:isDeleted> "false"^^xsd:boolean
    ------------------------------------
```

The constraint `[Constraint j != k]` means that the premises will be
satisfied only if the variables `j` and `k` do not refer to the same
thing.

With these optimisations, the rule is faster by several orders of
magnitude.

Since properties whose objects can be marked as deleted must be handled
differently to properties whose objects cannot be marked as deleted, the
`knora-base` ontology provides a property called
`objectCannotBeMarkedAsDeleted`. All properties in `knora-base` whose
objects cannot take the `isDeleted` flag (including datatype properties)
should be derived from this property. This is how it is used to check
`owl:maxCardinality 1` for objects that cannot be marked as deleted:

```
Consistency: max_cardinality_1_without_deletion_flag
    i p r [Context <onto:_maxCardinality_1_table>]
    p <rdfs:subPropertyOf> <knora-base:objectCannotBeMarkedAsDeleted>
    i p j [Constraint j != k]
    i p k [Cut]
    ------------------------------------
```

To check `owl:minCardinality 1`, we do not care whether the object can
be marked as deleted, so we can use this simple rule:

```
Consistency: min_cardinality_1_any_object
    i p r [Context <onto:_minCardinality_1_table>]
    ------------------------------------
    i p j
```

This means: if a subject `i` belongs to a class that has
`owl:minCardinality 1` on property `p`, and `i` has no object for `p`,
the rule is violated.

To check `owl:cardinality 1`, we need two rules: one that checks whether
there are too few objects, and one that checks whether there are too
many. To check whether there are too few objects, we don't care whether
the objects can be marked as deleted, so the rule is the same as
`min_cardinality_1_any_object`, except for the cardinality:

```
Consistency: cardinality_1_not_less_any_object
    i p r [Context <onto:_cardinality_1_table>]
    ------------------------------------
    i p j
```

To check whether there are too many objects, we need to know whether the
objects can be marked as deleted or not. In the case where the objects
can be marked as deleted, the rule is the same as
`max_cardinality_1_with_deletion_flag`, except for the cardinality:

```
Consistency: cardinality_1_not_greater_with_deletion_flag
    i p r [Context <onto:_cardinality_1_table>]
    i p j [Constraint j != k]
    i p k [Cut]
    j <knora-base:isDeleted> "false"^^xsd:boolean
    k <knora-base:isDeleted> "false"^^xsd:boolean
    ------------------------------------
```

In the case where the objects cannot be marked as deleted, the rule is
the same as `max_cardinality_1_without_deletion_flag`, except for the
cardinality:

```
Consistency: cardinality_1_not_less_any_object
    i p r [Context <onto:_cardinality_1_table>]
    ------------------------------------
    i p j
```

Knora allows a subproperty of `knora-base:hasValue` or
`knora-base:hasLinkTo` to be a predicate of a resource only if the
resource's class has some cardinality for the property. For convenience,
`knora-base:hasValue` and `knora-base:hasLinkTo` are subproperties of
`knora-base:resourceProperty`, which is used to check this constraint in
the following rule:

```
Consistency: resource_prop_cardinality_any
    i <knora-base:resourceProperty> j
    ------------------------------------
    i p j
    i <rdf:type> r
    r <owl:onProperty> p
```

If resource `i` has a subproperty of `knora-base:resourceProperty`, and
`i` is not a member of a subclass of an `owl:Restriction` `r` with a
cardinality on that property (or on one of its base properties), the
rule is violated.

A similar rule, `value_prop_cardinality_any`, ensures that if a value
has a subproperty of `knora-base:valueHas`, the value's class has some
cardinality for that property.
