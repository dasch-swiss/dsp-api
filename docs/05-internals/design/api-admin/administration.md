# Administration

## Permissions


The permissions API endpoint is described [in the permission documentation](../../../03-endpoints/api-admin/permissions.md).

The default permissions when a project is created are described
[admin api documenation](../../../03-endpoints/api-admin/projects.md#default-set-of-permissions-for-a-new-project).

DSP's concept of access control is that permissions 
can only be granted to groups and not to individual users.
There are two distinct ways of granting permission.

1. An object (a resource or value) can grant permissions to groups of users.
2. Permissions can be granted directly to a group of users (not bound to a specific object).

There are six built-in groups: 
*UnknownUser*, *KnownUser*, *Creator*, *ProjectMember*, *ProjectAdmin*, and *SystemAdmin*. 
These groups can be used in the same way as normal user created groups for permission
management, i.e. can be used to give certain groups of users, certain
permissions, without the need to explicitly create them.

A user becomes implicitly a member of such a group by satisfying certain conditions:

- **knora-admin:UnknownUser**:  
  Any user who has not logged into the DSP is automatically assigned to this group.  
  Group IRI: `http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-admin#UnknownUser`

- **knora-admin:KnownUser**:  
  Any user who has logged into the DSP is automatically assigned to this group.  
  Group IRI: `http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-admin#KnownUser`


- **knora-admin:Creator**:  
  When checking a user’s permissions on an object, the user is automatically assigned to this group 
  if they are the creator of the object.  
  Group IRI: `http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-admin#Creator`

- **knora-admin:ProjectMember**:  
  When checking a user’s permissions, the user is automatically assigned to this group 
  by being a member of a project designated by the `knora-admin:isInProject` property.  
  Group IRI: `http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-admin#ProjectMember`

- **knora-admin:ProjectAdmin**:  
  When checking a user's permission, the user is automatically assigned to this group 
  through the `knora-admin:isInProjectAdminGroup` property, which points to the  project in question.  
  Group IRI: `http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-admin#ProjectAdmin`

- **knora-admin:SystemAdmin**:  
  Membership is received by setting the property `knora-admin:isInSystemAdminGroup` to `true` on a `knora-admin:User`.  
  Group IRI: `http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-admin#SystemAdmin`

There are three kinds of permissions:

1. *object access permissions*, which contain permissions 
   that point from explicit **objects** (resources/values) to groups.
2. *administrative permissions*, which contain permissions 
   that are put on instances of `knora-admin:Permission` objects directly affecting groups. 
3. *default object access permissions* which are also put on instances of `knora-admin:Permission`,
   and which also directly affect groups.

### Object Access Permissions

An object (resource / value) can grant the following permissions, which
are stored in a compact format in a single string, which is the object
of the predicate `knora-base:hasPermissions`:

1. **Restricted view permission (RV)**: Allows a restricted view of
   the object, e.g. a view of an image with a watermark.
2. **View permission (V)**: Allows an unrestricted view of the
   object. Having view permission on a resource only affects the
   user's ability to view information about the resource other than
   its values. To view a value, she must have view permission on the
   value itself.
3. **Modify permission (M)**: For values, this permission allows a
   new version of a value to be created. For resources, this allows
   the user to create a new value (as opposed to a new version of an
   existing value), or to change information about the resource other
   than its values. When he wants to make a new version of a value,
   his permissions on the containing resource are not relevant.
   However, when he wants to change the target of a link, the old
   link must be deleted and a new one created, so he needs modify
   permission on the resource.
4. **Delete permission (D)**: Allows the item to be marked as deleted.
5. **Change rights permission (CR)**: Allows the permissions granted by the object to be changed.

Each permission in the above list implies all lower-numbered
permissions.

A user's permission level on a particular object is calculated in
the following way:

1. Make a list of the groups that the user belongs to, including
   Creator and/or ProjectMember and/or ProjectAdmin if applicable.
2. Make a list of the permissions that she can obtain on the
   object, by iterating over the permissions that the object
   grants. For each permission, if she is in the specified group,
   add the specified permission to the list of permissions she can
   obtain.
3. From the resulting list, select the highest-level permission.
4. If the result is that she would have no permissions, give her
   whatever permission *UnknownUser* would have.

The format of the object of `knora-base:hasPermissions` is as
follows:

- Each permission is represented by the one-letter or two-letter
  abbreviation given above.
- Each permission abbreviation is followed by a space, then a
  comma-separated list of groups that the permission is granted
  to.
- The IRIs of built-in groups are shortened using the knora-admin
  prefix.
- Multiple permissions are separated by a vertical bar (|).

For example, if an object grants view permission to *unknown* and *known
users*, and modify permission to *project members*, the resulting
permission literal would be: `V knora-admin:UnknownUser,knora-admin:KnownUser|M knora-admin:ProjectMember`.

### Administrative Permissions

The following permissions can be set via instances of
`knora-admin:AdministrativePermission` on any group belonging to a
project. For users that are members of a number of groups with
administrative permissions attached, the final set of permissions is
additive and most permissive. The administrative permissions are stored
in a compact format in a single string, which is the object of the
predicate `knora-base:hasPermissions` attached to an instance of the
`knora-admin:AdministrativePermission` class. The following permission
values can be used:

1. Resource / Value Creation Permissions:
    1) **ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission**:
        - description: gives the permission to create resources inside the project.
        - usage: used as a value for *knora-base:hasPermissions*.
    2) **ProjectResourceCreateRestrictedPermission**:
        - description: gives restricted resource creation permission inside the project.
        - usage: used as a value for *knora-base:hasPermissions*.
        - value: `RestrictedProjectResourceCreatePermission`
          followed by a comma-separated list of *ResourceClasses*
          the user should only be able to create instances of.
2. Project Administration Permissions:
    1) **ProjectAdminAllPermission**:
        - description: gives the user the permission to do anything
          on project level, i.e. create new groups, modify all
          existing groups (*group info*, *group membership*,
          *resource creation permissions*, *project administration
          permissions*, and *default permissions*).
        - usage: used as a value for *knora-base:hasPermissions*.
    2) **ProjectAdminGroupAllPermission**:
        - description: gives the user the permission to modify
          *group info* and *group membership* on *all* groups
          belonging to the project.
        - usage: used as a value for the *knora-base:hasPermissions* property.
    3) **ProjectAdminGroupRestrictedPermission**:
        - description: gives the user the permission to modify
          *group info* and *group membership* on *certain* groups
          belonging to the project.
        - usage: used as a value for *knora-base:hasPermissions*
        - value: `ProjectGroupAdminRestrictedPermission` followed by
          a comma-separated list of `knora-admin:UserGroup`.
    4) **ProjectAdminRightsAllPermission**:
        - description: gives the user the permission to change the
          *permissions* on all objects belonging to the project
          (e.g., default permissions attached to groups and
          permissions on objects).
        - usage: used as a value for the *knora-base:hasPermissions* property.

The administrative permissions are stored in a compact format in a
single string, which is the object of the predicate
`knora-base:hasPermissions` attached to an instance of the
`knora-admin:AdministrativePermission` class.

- The format of the object of `knora-base:hasPermissions` is as follows:
    - Each permission is represented by the name given above.
    - Each permission is followed by a space, then if applicable, by comma separated list of IRIs, as defined above.
    - The IRIs of built-in values (e.g., built-in groups, resource
      classes, etc.) are shortened using the knora-admin prefix `knora-admin:`.
    - Multiple permissions are separated by a vertical bar (|).

For example, if an administrative permission grants the
`knora-admin:ProjectMember` group the permission to create all resources
(*ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission*), the resulting administrative
permission object with the compact form literal would be: :

```
<http://rdfh.ch/permissions/001
        rdf:type knora-admin:AdministrativePermission ;
        knora-admin:forProject <http://rdfh.ch/projects/00FF>;
        knora-admin:forGroup knora-admin:ProjectMember ;
        knora-base:hasPermissions "ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission"^^xsd:string .
```

### Default Object Access Permissions

Default Object Access Permissions are used when new objects (resources
and/or values) are created. They represent object access permissions
with which the new object will be initially outfitted. As with
administrative permissions, these default object access permissions can
be defined for any number of groups. Additionally, they can be also
defined for resource classes and properties.

The following default object access permissions can be attached to
groups, resource classes and/or properties via instances of
*knora-admin:DefaultObjectAccessPermission* (described further bellow).
The default object access permissions correspond to the earlier
described object access permission:

1. **Default Restricted View Permission (RV)**:
    - description: any object, created by a user inside a group
      holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission
    - value: `RV` followed by a comma-separated list of `knora-admin:UserGroup`
2. **Default View Permission (V)**:
    - description: any object, created by a user inside a group
      holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission
    - value: `V` followed by a comma-separated list of `knora-admin:UserGroup`
3. **Default Modify Permission (M)** accompanied by a list of groups.
    - description: any object, created by a user inside a group
      holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission
    - value: `M` followed by a comma-separated list of `knora-admin:UserGroup`
4. **Default Delete Permission (D)** accompanied by a list of groups.
    - description: any object, created by a user inside a group
      holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission
    - value: `D` followed by a comma-separated list of `knora-admin:UserGroup`
5. **Default Change Rights Permission (CR)** accompanied by a list of groups.
    - description: any object, created by a user inside a group
      holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission
    - value: `CR` followed by a comma-separated list of `knora-admin:UserGroup`

A single instance of `knora-admin:DefaultObjectAccessPermission` must
always reference a project, but can only reference **either** a group
(`knora-admin:forGroup` property), a resource class
(`knora-admin:forResourceClass`), a property (`knora-admin:forProperty`),
or a combination of resource class **and** property.

Example default object access permission instance:

```
<http://rdfh.ch/permissions/002
        rdf:type knora-admin:DefaultObjectAccessPermission ;
        knora-admin:forProject <http://rdfh.ch/projects/00FF>;
        knora-admin:forGroup knora-admin:ProjectMember ;
        knora-base:hasPermissions "CR knora-admin:Creator|M knora-admin:ProjectMember|V knora-admin:KnownUser"^^xsd:string .
```

This instance is setting default object access permissions to the
project member group of a project, giving change right permission to the
creator, modify permission to all project members, and view permission
to known users. Further, this **implicitly** applies to all resource
classes and all their properties inside the project.

### Permission Precedence Rules

For both administrative permissions and default object access
permissions, the resulting permissions are derived by applying
precedence rules, for the case that the user is member of more than one
group.

The following list is sorted by the permission precedence level in
descending order:

- permissions on `knora-admin:ProjectAdmin` (highest level)
- permissions on resource classes and property combination (own project)
- permissions on properties (own project, when creating a Value)
- permissions on resource classes (own project, when creating a Resource)
- permissions on custom groups
- permissions on `knora-admin:ProjectMember`

The permissions on resource classes / properties are only relevant for
default object access permissions.

**Administrative Permissions**: When a user performs an operation
requiring administrative permissions, then **only** the permissions from
the **highest level** are taken into account. If a user is a member of
more than one group on the same level (only possible for custom groups)
then the defined permissions are summed up and all are taken into
account.

**Default Object Access Permissions**: When a user creates a resource or
value, then **only** the default object permissions from the **highest
level** are applied. If a user is a member of more than one group on the
same level (only possible for custom groups) then the defined
permissions are summed up and the most permissive are applied.

In the case of the user belonging to the **SystemAdmin** group, but which
is not member of a project and thus not member of any group belonging
to the project, the *default object access permissions* from the
**ProjectAdmin**, or **ProjectMember** group will be
applied in the order of precedence. If no permissions are defined on
either of these groups, then the resulting permission will be `CR knora-admin:Creator`.

## Implicit Permissions

The `knora-admin:SystemAdmin` group receives implicitly the following
permissions:

- receives implicitly *ProjectAdminAllPermission* for all projects.
- receives implicitly *ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission* for all projects.
- receives implicitly *CR* on all objects from all projects.

These permissions are baked into the system, and cannot be changed.

## Default Permissions Matrix for new Projects

The access control matrix defines what are the default operations a
*subject* (i.e. User), being a member of a built-in group (represented
by row headers), is permitted to perform on an *object* (represented by
column headers). The different operation abbreviations used are defined
as follows:

- *C*: *Create* - the subject inside the group is allowed to *create* the object.

- *U*: *Update* - the subject inside the group is allowed to *update* the object.

- *R*: *Read* - the subject inside the group is allowed to *read* **all** information about the object.

- *D*: *Delete* - the subject inside the group is allowed to *delete* the object.

- *P*: *Permission* - the subject inside the group is allowed to change the *permissions* on the object.

- *-*: *none* - none or not applicable

| Built-In Group    | Project | Group   | User                | Resource               | Value                |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| **SystemAdmin**   | `CRUD`  | `CRUDP` | `CRUDP` all         | `CRUDP` all            | `CRUDP` all          |
| **ProjectAdmin**  | `-RUD`  | `CRUDP` | `CRUDP` +/- project | `CRUDP` (in project)   | `CRUDP` (in project) |
| **ProjectMember** | `----`  | `-----` | `-----`             | `CRU--` (in project)   | `-----` (in project) |
| **Creator**       | `----`  | `-----` | `-----`             | `-----` (his resource) | `-----` (his value)  |
| **KnownUser**     | `C---`  | `C----` | `CRUD-` himself     | `-----` (in project)   | `-----` (in project) |

Default Permissions Matrix for new Projects

The explicitly defined default permissions for a new project are as follows:

- `knora-admin:ProjectAdmin` group:
    - **Administrative Permissions:**
        - *ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission*.
        - *ProjectAdminAllPermission*.
    - **Default Object Access Permissions:**
        - *CR* for the *knora-admin:ProjectAdmin* group
        - *D* for the *knora-admin:ProjectAdmin* group
        - *M* for the *knora-admin:ProjectAdmin* group
        - *V* for the *knora-admin:ProjectAdmin* group
        - *RV* for the *knora-admin:ProjectAdmin* group

- The `knora-admin:ProjectMember` group:
    - **Administrative Permissions:**
        - *ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission*.
    - **Default Object Access Permissions:**
        - *M* for the *knora-admin:ProjectMember* group
        - *V* for the *knora-admin:ProjectMember* group
        - *RV* for the *knora-admin:ProjectMember* group

## Basic Workflows involving Permissions

### Accessing a Resource/Value

### Project / Group Administration

![Figure 1](administration-fig3.dot.png "Figure 3")

## Implementation

The requirements for defining default permissions imposed by all the
different use cases are very broad. Potentially, we need to be able to
define default permissions per project, per group, per resource class,
per resource property, and all their possible combinations.

For this reason, we introduce the *knora-admin:Permission* class with two
sub-classes, namely *knora-admin:AdministrativePermission* and
*knora-admin:DefaultObjectAccessPermission*, which instances will carry
all the necessary information.

### Permission Class Hierarchy and Structure

permission class.

```

**Default Object Access Permission Structure**:

and the same as RDF:

```

     knora-admin:forProject <http://rdfh.ch/projects/[shortcode]> ;
     knora-admin:forGroup <http://rdfh.ch/groups/[shortcode]/[UUID]> ;
     knora-admin:forResourceClass "Resource Class Name" ;

                                 D <http://rdfh.ch/groups/[shortcode]/[UUID]>|
                                CR <http://rdfh.ch/groups/[shortcode]/[UUID]>"^^xsd:string .
```

### Querying Permission Instances

The properties **forProject** and either of **forGroup**,
**forResourceClass**, and **forProperty** form together a *compound
key*, allowing finding existing permission instances, that address the
same set of Project / Group / ResourceClass / Property combination, thus
making it possible to extend or change the attached permissions.

**Administrative Permission Instances**: For each group inside the
project, there can be **zero** or **one** instance holding
administrative permission information. Querying is straitforward by
using the *knora-admin:forProject* and *knora-admin:forGroup* properties
as the compound key.

**Default Object Access Permission Instances**: For each group, resource
class, or property inside the project, there can be **zero** or **one**
instances holding default object access permission informations.
Querying is straitforward by using the *knora-admin:forProject* and
either *knora-admin:forGroup*, *knora-admin:forResourceClass*, or
*knora-admin:forProperty* properties as part of the compound key.

                                 V knora-admin:KnownUser,knora-admin:UnknownUser"^^xsd:string .
```

When the user's `UserProfile` is queried, all permissions for all
projects and groups the user is a member of are also queried. This
information is then stored as an easy accessible object inside the
`UserProfile`, being readily available wherever needed. As this is a
somewhat expensive operation, built-in caching mechanism at different
levels (e.g., UsersResponder, PermissionsResponder), will be applied.
