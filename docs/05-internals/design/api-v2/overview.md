# API v2 Design Overview

## General Principles

- DSP-API v2 requests and responses are RDF documents. Any API v2
  response can be returned as [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/),
  [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/),
  or [RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/).
- Each class or property used in a request or response has a definition in an ontology, which Knora can serve.
- Response formats are reused for different requests whenever
  possible, to minimise the number of different response formats a
  client has to handle. For example, any request for one or more
  resources (such as a search result, or a request for one specific
  resource) returns a response in the same format.
- Response size is limited by design. Large amounts of data must be
  retrieved by requesting small pages of data, one after the other.
- Responses that provide data are distinct from responses that provide
  definitions (i.e. ontology entities). Data responses indicate which
  types are used, and the client can request information about these
  types separately.

## API Schemas

The types used in the triplestore are not exposed directly in the API.
Instead, they are mapped onto API 'schemas'. Two schemas are currently
provided.

- A complex schema, which is suitable both for reading and for editing
  data. The complex schema represents values primarily as complex objects.
- A simple schema, which is suitable for reading data but not for
  editing it. The simple schema facilitates interoperability between
  DSP ontologies and non-DSP ontologies, since it represents
  values primarily as literals.

Each schema has its own type IRIs, which are derived from the ones used
in the triplestore. For details of these different IRI formats, see
[Knora IRIs](../../../03-endpoints/api-v2/knora-iris.md).

## Implementation

### JSON-LD Parsing and Formatting

Each API response is represented by a class that extends
`KnoraResponseV2`, which has a method `toJsonLDDocument` that specifies
the target schema. It is currently up to each route to determine what
the appropriate response schema should be. Some routes will support only
one response schema. Others will allow the client to choose, and there
will be one or more standard ways for the client to specify the desired
response schema.

A route calls `RouteUtilV2.runRdfRoute`, passing a request message and
a response schema. When `RouteUtilV2` gets the response message from the
responder, it calls `toJsonLDDocument` on it, specifying that schema.
The response message returns a `JsonLDDocument`, which is a simple data
structure that is then converted to Java objects and passed to the
JSON-LD Java library for formatting. In general, `toJsonLDDocument` is
implemented in two stages: first the object converts itself to the
target schema, and then the resulting object is converted to a
`JsonLDDocument`.

A route that receives JSON-LD requests should use
`JsonLDUtil.parseJsonLD` to convert each request to a `JsonLDDocument`.

### Generation of Other RDF Formats

`RouteUtilV2.runRdfRoute` implements
[HTTP content negotiation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.2), and converts JSON-LD
responses into [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/)
or [RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/) as appropriate.

### Operation Wrappers

Whenever possible, the same data structures are used for input and
output. Often more data is available in output than in input. For
example, when a value is read from the triplestore, its IRI is
available, but when it is being created, it does not yet have an IRI. In
such cases, there is a class like `ValueContentV2`, which represents the
data that is used both for input and for output. When a value is read, a
`ValueContentV2` is wrapped in a `ReadValueV2`, which additionally
contains the value's IRI. When a value is created, it is wrapped in a
`CreateValueV2`, which has the resource IRI and the property IRI, but
not the value IRI.

A `Read*` wrapper can be wrapped in another `Read*` wrapper; for
example, a `ReadResourceV2` contains `ReadValueV2` objects.

Each `*Content*` class should extend `KnoraContentV2` and thus have a
`toOntologySchema` method or converting itself between internal and
external schemas, in either direction.

Each `Read*` wrapper class should have a method for converting itself to
JSON-LD in a particular external schema. If the `Read*` wrapper is a
`KnoraResponseV2`, this method is `toJsonLDDocument`.

### Smart IRIs

#### Usage

The `SmartIri` trait can be used to parse and validate IRIs, and in
particular for converting Knora type IRIs between internal and external
schemas. It validates each IRI it parses. To use it, import the
following:

```scala
import org.knora.webapi.messages.{SmartIri, StringFormatter}
import org.knora.webapi.messages.IriConversions.*
```

Ensure that an implicit instance of `StringFormatter` is in scope:

```scala
implicit val stringFormatter: StringFormatter = StringFormatter.getGeneralInstance
```

Then, if `iriStr` is a string representing an IRI, you can can convert
it to a `SmartIri` like this:

```scala
val iri: SmartIri = iriStr.toSmartIri
```

If the IRI came from a request, use this method to throw a specific
exception if the IRI is invalid:

```scala
val iri: SmartIri = iriStr.toSmartIriWithErr(
    () => throw BadRequestException(s"Invalid IRI: $iriStr")
)
```

You can then use methods such as `SmartIri.isKnoraApiV2EntityIri` and
`SmartIri.getProjectCode` to obtain information about the IRI. To
convert it to another schema, call `SmartIri.toOntologySchema`.
Converting a non-Knora IRI returns the same IRI.

If the IRI represents a Knora internal value class such as
`knora-base:TextValue`, converting it to the `ApiV2Simple` schema will
return the corresponding simplified type, such as `xsd:string`. But this
conversion is not performed in the other direction (external to
internal), since this would require knowledge of the context in which
the IRI is being used.

The performance penalty for using a `SmartIri` instead of a string is
very small. Instances are automatically cached once they are
constructed. Parsing and caching a `SmartIri` instance takes about 10-20
µs, and retrieving a cached `SmartIri` takes about 1 µs.

There is no advantage to using `SmartIri` for data IRIs, since they are
not schema-specific (and are not cached). If a data IRI has been
received from a client request, it is better just to validate it using
`StringFormatter.validateAndEscapeIri`.

#### Smart IRI Implementation

The smart IRI implementation, `SmartIriImpl`, is nested in the
`StringFormatter` class, because it uses Knora's
hostname, which isn't available until the Akka ActorSystem has started.
However, this means that the type of a `SmartIriImpl` instance is
dependent on the instance of `StringFormatter` that constructed it.
Therefore, instances of `SmartIriImpl` created by different instances of
`StringFormatter` can't be compared directly.

There are in fact two instances of `StringFormatter`:

- one returned by `StringFormatter.getGeneralInstance` which is
  available after Akka has started and has the API server's hostname
  (and can therefore provide `SmartIri` instances capable of parsing
  IRIs containing that hostname). This instance is used throughout the
  DSP-API server.
- one returned by `StringFormatter.getInstanceForConstantOntologies`,
  which is available before Akka has started, and is used only by the
  hard-coded constant `knora-api` ontologies.

This is the reason for the existence of the `SmartIri` trait, which is a
top-level definition and has its own `equals` and `hashCode` methods.
Instances of `SmartIri` can thus be compared (e.g. to use them as unique
keys in collections), regardless of which instance of `StringFormatter`
created them.
