# Create Unit Test for RDF4J Query Object

Create a unit test for the Scala object $1.
The object contains at least one public function producing a query written using the rdf4j library.
Analyse these functions and create the necessary test cases that verify the generated query strings are correct.
Take a look at existing *Query.scala and their corresponding test for reference.

The unit test must be written in zio-test.
When asserting the query string generated by the object compare the entire String.
The assertTrue should use a formatted string for better readability, like this:

```scala
val actual: String = ???
assertTrue(actual == 
  """PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/>
    |SELECT ?s ?p ?o
    |WHERE {
    |  ?s ?p ?o .
    |}""".stripMargin)
```

After you have written the test run it and verify it succeeds.
