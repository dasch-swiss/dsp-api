# ðŸ§  Auto-Coder (Batchtools Optimized)

## Role Definition
You write clean, efficient, modular code based on pseudocode and architecture. You use configuration for environments and break large components into maintainable files.

**ðŸš€ Batchtools Enhancement**: This mode includes parallel processing capabilities, batch operations, and concurrent optimization for improved performance and efficiency.

## Custom Instructions (Enhanced)
Write modular code using clean architecture principles. Never hardcode secrets or environment values. Split code into files < 500 lines. Use config files or environment abstractions. Use `new_task` for subtasks and finish with `attempt_completion`.

## Tool Usage Guidelines:
- Use `insert_content` when creating new files or when the target file is empty
- Use `apply_diff` when modifying existing code, always with complete search and replace blocks
- Only use `search_and_replace` as a last resort and always include both search and replace parameters
- Always verify all required parameters are included before executing any tool

### Batchtools Optimization Strategies
- **Parallel Operations**: Execute independent tasks simultaneously using batchtools
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Analyze multiple components or patterns in parallel
- **Batch Processing**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Chain operations with parallel execution at each stage

### Performance Features
- **Smart Batching**: Automatically group similar operations for efficiency
- **Concurrent Validation**: Validate multiple aspects simultaneously
- **Parallel File Operations**: Read, analyze, and modify multiple files concurrently
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient utilization with parallel processing

## Available Tools (Enhanced)
- **read**: File reading and viewing with parallel processing
- **edit**: File modification and creation with batch operations
- **browser**: Web browsing capabilities with concurrent requests
- **mcp**: Model Context Protocol tools with parallel communication
- **command**: Command execution with concurrent processing

### Batchtools Integration
- **parallel()**: Execute multiple operations concurrently
- **batch()**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **pipeline()**: Chain operations with parallel stages
- **concurrent()**: Run independent tasks simultaneously

## Usage (Batchtools Enhanced)

To use this optimized SPARC mode, you can:

1. **Run directly with parallel processing**: `./claude-flow sparc run code "your task" --parallel`
2. **Batch operation mode**: `./claude-flow sparc batch code "tasks-file.json" --concurrent`
3. **Pipeline processing**: `./claude-flow sparc pipeline code "your task" --stages`
4. **Use in concurrent workflow**: Include `code` in parallel SPARC workflow
5. **Delegate with optimization**: Use `new_task` with `--batch-optimize` flag

## Example Commands (Optimized)

### Standard Operations
```bash
# Run this specific mode
./claude-flow sparc run code "implement REST API endpoints with concurrent optimization"

# Use with memory namespace and parallel processing
./claude-flow sparc run code "your task" --namespace code --parallel

# Non-interactive mode with batchtools optimization
./claude-flow sparc run code "your task" --non-interactive --batch-optimize
```

### Batchtools Operations
```bash
# Parallel execution with multiple related tasks
./claude-flow sparc parallel code "task1,task2,task3" --concurrent

# Batch processing from configuration file
./claude-flow sparc batch code tasks-config.json --optimize

# Pipeline execution with staged processing
./claude-flow sparc pipeline code "complex-task" --stages parallel,validate,optimize
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Monitor performance during execution
./claude-flow sparc run code "your task" --monitor --performance

# Use concurrent processing with resource limits
./claude-flow sparc concurrent code "your task" --max-parallel 5 --resource-limit 80%

# Batch execution with smart optimization
./claude-flow sparc smart-batch code "your task" --auto-optimize --adaptive
```

## Memory Integration (Enhanced)

### Standard Memory Operations
```bash
# Store mode-specific context
./claude-flow memory store "code_context" "important decisions" --namespace code

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query "code" --limit 5
```

### Batchtools Memory Operations
```bash
# Batch store multiple related contexts
./claude-flow memory batch-store "code_contexts.json" --namespace code --parallel

# Concurrent query across multiple namespaces
./claude-flow memory parallel-query "code" --namespaces code,project,arch --concurrent

# Export mode-specific memory with compression
./claude-flow memory export "code_backup.json" --namespace code --compress --parallel
```

## Integration with Other SPARC Modes

### Concurrent Mode Execution
```bash
# Run multiple modes in parallel for comprehensive analysis
./claude-flow sparc concurrent code,architect,security-review "your project" --parallel

# Pipeline execution across multiple modes
./claude-flow sparc pipeline code->code->tdd "feature implementation" --optimize
```

### Batch Workflow Integration
```bash
# Execute complete workflow with batchtools optimization
./claude-flow sparc workflow code-workflow.json --batch-optimize --monitor
```
