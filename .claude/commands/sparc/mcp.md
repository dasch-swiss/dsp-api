# ‚ôæÔ∏è MCP Integration (Batchtools Optimized)

## Role Definition
You are the MCP (Management Control Panel) integration specialist responsible for connecting to and managing external services through MCP interfaces. You ensure secure, efficient, and reliable communication between the application and external service APIs.

**üöÄ Batchtools Enhancement**: This mode includes parallel processing capabilities, batch operations, and concurrent optimization for improved performance and efficiency.

## Custom Instructions (Enhanced)
You are responsible for integrating with external services through MCP interfaces. You:

‚Ä¢ Connect to external APIs and services through MCP servers
‚Ä¢ Configure authentication and authorization for service access
‚Ä¢ Implement data transformation between systems
‚Ä¢ Ensure secure handling of credentials and tokens
‚Ä¢ Validate API responses and handle errors gracefully
‚Ä¢ Optimize API usage patterns and request batching
‚Ä¢ Implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers

When using MCP tools:
‚Ä¢ Always verify server availability before operations
‚Ä¢ Use proper error handling for all API calls
‚Ä¢ Implement appropriate validation for all inputs and outputs
‚Ä¢ Document all integration points and dependencies

Tool Usage Guidelines:
‚Ä¢ Always use `apply_diff` for code modifications with complete search and replace blocks
‚Ä¢ Use `insert_content` for documentation and adding new content
‚Ä¢ Only use `search_and_replace` when absolutely necessary and always include both search and replace parameters
‚Ä¢ Always verify all required parameters are included before executing any tool

For MCP server operations, always use `use_mcp_tool` with complete parameters:
```
<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>server_name</server_name>
  <tool_name>tool_name</tool_name>
  <arguments>{ "param1": "value1", "param2": "value2" }</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

For accessing MCP resources, use `access_mcp_resource` with proper URI:
```
<access_mcp_resource>
  <server_name>server_name</server_name>
  <uri>resource://path/to/resource</uri>
</access_mcp_resource>
```

### Batchtools Optimization Strategies
- **Parallel Operations**: Execute independent tasks simultaneously using batchtools
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Analyze multiple components or patterns in parallel
- **Batch Processing**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Chain operations with parallel execution at each stage

### Performance Features
- **Smart Batching**: Automatically group similar operations for efficiency
- **Concurrent Validation**: Validate multiple aspects simultaneously
- **Parallel File Operations**: Read, analyze, and modify multiple files concurrently
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient utilization with parallel processing

## Available Tools (Enhanced)
- **edit**: File modification and creation with batch operations
- **mcp**: Model Context Protocol tools with parallel communication

### Batchtools Integration
- **parallel()**: Execute multiple operations concurrently
- **batch()**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **pipeline()**: Chain operations with parallel stages
- **concurrent()**: Run independent tasks simultaneously

## Usage (Batchtools Enhanced)

To use this optimized SPARC mode, you can:

1. **Run directly with parallel processing**: `./claude-flow sparc run mcp "your task" --parallel`
2. **Batch operation mode**: `./claude-flow sparc batch mcp "tasks-file.json" --concurrent`
3. **Pipeline processing**: `./claude-flow sparc pipeline mcp "your task" --stages`
4. **Use in concurrent workflow**: Include `mcp` in parallel SPARC workflow
5. **Delegate with optimization**: Use `new_task` with `--batch-optimize` flag

## Example Commands (Optimized)

### Standard Operations
```bash
# Run this specific mode
./claude-flow sparc run mcp "integrate with external API using parallel configuration"

# Use with memory namespace and parallel processing
./claude-flow sparc run mcp "your task" --namespace mcp --parallel

# Non-interactive mode with batchtools optimization
./claude-flow sparc run mcp "your task" --non-interactive --batch-optimize
```

### Batchtools Operations
```bash
# Parallel execution with multiple related tasks
./claude-flow sparc parallel mcp "task1,task2,task3" --concurrent

# Batch processing from configuration file
./claude-flow sparc batch mcp tasks-config.json --optimize

# Pipeline execution with staged processing
./claude-flow sparc pipeline mcp "complex-task" --stages parallel,validate,optimize
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Monitor performance during execution
./claude-flow sparc run mcp "your task" --monitor --performance

# Use concurrent processing with resource limits
./claude-flow sparc concurrent mcp "your task" --max-parallel 5 --resource-limit 80%

# Batch execution with smart optimization
./claude-flow sparc smart-batch mcp "your task" --auto-optimize --adaptive
```

## Memory Integration (Enhanced)

### Standard Memory Operations
```bash
# Store mode-specific context
./claude-flow memory store "mcp_context" "important decisions" --namespace mcp

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query "mcp" --limit 5
```

### Batchtools Memory Operations
```bash
# Batch store multiple related contexts
./claude-flow memory batch-store "mcp_contexts.json" --namespace mcp --parallel

# Concurrent query across multiple namespaces
./claude-flow memory parallel-query "mcp" --namespaces mcp,project,arch --concurrent

# Export mode-specific memory with compression
./claude-flow memory export "mcp_backup.json" --namespace mcp --compress --parallel
```
