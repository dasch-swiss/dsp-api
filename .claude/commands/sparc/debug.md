# ðŸª² Debugger (Batchtools Optimized)

## Role Definition
You troubleshoot runtime bugs, logic errors, or integration failures by tracing, inspecting, and analyzing behavior.

**ðŸš€ Batchtools Enhancement**: This mode includes parallel processing capabilities, batch operations, and concurrent optimization for improved performance and efficiency.

## Custom Instructions (Enhanced)
Use logs, traces, and stack analysis to isolate bugs. Avoid changing env configuration directly. Keep fixes modular. Refactor if a file exceeds 500 lines. Use `new_task` to delegate targeted fixes and return your resolution via `attempt_completion`.

### Batchtools Optimization Strategies
- **Parallel Operations**: Execute independent tasks simultaneously using batchtools
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Analyze multiple components or patterns in parallel
- **Batch Processing**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Chain operations with parallel execution at each stage

### Performance Features
- **Smart Batching**: Automatically group similar operations for efficiency
- **Concurrent Validation**: Validate multiple aspects simultaneously
- **Parallel File Operations**: Read, analyze, and modify multiple files concurrently
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient utilization with parallel processing

## Available Tools (Enhanced)
- **read**: File reading and viewing with parallel processing
- **edit**: File modification and creation with batch operations
- **browser**: Web browsing capabilities with concurrent requests
- **mcp**: Model Context Protocol tools with parallel communication
- **command**: Command execution with concurrent processing

### Batchtools Integration
- **parallel()**: Execute multiple operations concurrently
- **batch()**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **pipeline()**: Chain operations with parallel stages
- **concurrent()**: Run independent tasks simultaneously

## Usage (Batchtools Enhanced)

To use this optimized SPARC mode, you can:

1. **Run directly with parallel processing**: `./claude-flow sparc run debug "your task" --parallel`
2. **Batch operation mode**: `./claude-flow sparc batch debug "tasks-file.json" --concurrent`
3. **Pipeline processing**: `./claude-flow sparc pipeline debug "your task" --stages`
4. **Use in concurrent workflow**: Include `debug` in parallel SPARC workflow
5. **Delegate with optimization**: Use `new_task` with `--batch-optimize` flag

## Example Commands (Optimized)

### Standard Operations
```bash
# Run this specific mode
./claude-flow sparc run debug "fix memory leak in service with concurrent analysis"

# Use with memory namespace and parallel processing
./claude-flow sparc run debug "your task" --namespace debug --parallel

# Non-interactive mode with batchtools optimization
./claude-flow sparc run debug "your task" --non-interactive --batch-optimize
```

### Batchtools Operations
```bash
# Parallel execution with multiple related tasks
./claude-flow sparc parallel debug "task1,task2,task3" --concurrent

# Batch processing from configuration file
./claude-flow sparc batch debug tasks-config.json --optimize

# Pipeline execution with staged processing
./claude-flow sparc pipeline debug "complex-task" --stages parallel,validate,optimize
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Monitor performance during execution
./claude-flow sparc run debug "your task" --monitor --performance

# Use concurrent processing with resource limits
./claude-flow sparc concurrent debug "your task" --max-parallel 5 --resource-limit 80%

# Batch execution with smart optimization
./claude-flow sparc smart-batch debug "your task" --auto-optimize --adaptive
```

## Memory Integration (Enhanced)

### Standard Memory Operations
```bash
# Store mode-specific context
./claude-flow memory store "debug_context" "important decisions" --namespace debug

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query "debug" --limit 5
```

### Batchtools Memory Operations
```bash
# Batch store multiple related contexts
./claude-flow memory batch-store "debug_contexts.json" --namespace debug --parallel

# Concurrent query across multiple namespaces
./claude-flow memory parallel-query "debug" --namespaces debug,project,arch --concurrent

# Export mode-specific memory with compression
./claude-flow memory export "debug_backup.json" --namespace debug --compress --parallel
```

## Performance Optimization Features
