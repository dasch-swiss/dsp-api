# ðŸ“š Documentation Writer (Batchtools Optimized)

## Role Definition
You write concise, clear, and modular Markdown documentation that explains usage, integration, setup, and configuration.

**ðŸš€ Batchtools Enhancement**: This mode includes parallel processing capabilities, batch operations, and concurrent optimization for improved performance and efficiency.

## Custom Instructions (Enhanced)
Only work in .md files. Use sections, examples, and headings. Keep each file under 500 lines. Do not leak env values. Summarize what you wrote using `attempt_completion`. Delegate large guides with `new_task`.

### Batchtools Optimization Strategies
- **Parallel Operations**: Execute independent tasks simultaneously using batchtools
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Analyze multiple components or patterns in parallel
- **Batch Processing**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Chain operations with parallel execution at each stage

### Performance Features
- **Smart Batching**: Automatically group similar operations for efficiency
- **Concurrent Validation**: Validate multiple aspects simultaneously
- **Parallel File Operations**: Read, analyze, and modify multiple files concurrently
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient utilization with parallel processing

## Available Tools (Enhanced)
- **read**: File reading and viewing with parallel processing
- **edit**: Markdown files only (Files matching: \.md$) - *Batchtools enabled*

### Batchtools Integration
- **parallel()**: Execute multiple operations concurrently
- **batch()**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **pipeline()**: Chain operations with parallel stages
- **concurrent()**: Run independent tasks simultaneously

## Usage (Batchtools Enhanced)

To use this optimized SPARC mode, you can:

1. **Run directly with parallel processing**: `./claude-flow sparc run docs-writer "your task" --parallel`
2. **Batch operation mode**: `./claude-flow sparc batch docs-writer "tasks-file.json" --concurrent`
3. **Pipeline processing**: `./claude-flow sparc pipeline docs-writer "your task" --stages`
4. **Use in concurrent workflow**: Include `docs-writer` in parallel SPARC workflow
5. **Delegate with optimization**: Use `new_task` with `--batch-optimize` flag

## Example Commands (Optimized)

### Standard Operations
```bash
# Run this specific mode
./claude-flow sparc run docs-writer "create API documentation with concurrent content generation"

# Use with memory namespace and parallel processing
./claude-flow sparc run docs-writer "your task" --namespace docs-writer --parallel

# Non-interactive mode with batchtools optimization
./claude-flow sparc run docs-writer "your task" --non-interactive --batch-optimize
```

### Batchtools Operations
```bash
# Parallel execution with multiple related tasks
./claude-flow sparc parallel docs-writer "task1,task2,task3" --concurrent

# Batch processing from configuration file
./claude-flow sparc batch docs-writer tasks-config.json --optimize

# Pipeline execution with staged processing
./claude-flow sparc pipeline docs-writer "complex-task" --stages parallel,validate,optimize
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Monitor performance during execution
./claude-flow sparc run docs-writer "your task" --monitor --performance

# Use concurrent processing with resource limits
./claude-flow sparc concurrent docs-writer "your task" --max-parallel 5 --resource-limit 80%

# Batch execution with smart optimization
./claude-flow sparc smart-batch docs-writer "your task" --auto-optimize --adaptive
```

## Memory Integration (Enhanced)

### Standard Memory Operations
```bash
# Store mode-specific context
./claude-flow memory store "docs-writer_context" "important decisions" --namespace docs-writer

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query "docs-writer" --limit 5
```

### Batchtools Memory Operations
```bash
# Batch store multiple related contexts
./claude-flow memory batch-store "docs-writer_contexts.json" --namespace docs-writer --parallel

# Concurrent query across multiple namespaces
./claude-flow memory parallel-query "docs-writer" --namespaces docs-writer,project,arch --concurrent

# Export mode-specific memory with compression
./claude-flow memory export "docs-writer_backup.json" --namespace docs-writer --compress --parallel
```

## Performance Optimization Features

### Parallel Processing Capabilities
- **Concurrent File Operations**: Process multiple files simultaneously
- **Parallel Analysis**: Analyze multiple components or patterns concurrently
- **Batch Code Generation**: Create multiple code artifacts in parallel
- **Concurrent Validation**: Validate multiple aspects simultaneously

### Smart Batching Features
- **Operation Grouping**: Automatically group related operations
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient use of system resources
- **Pipeline Processing**: Chain operations with parallel stages
- **Adaptive Scaling**: Adjust concurrency based on system performance

### Performance Monitoring
- **Real-time Metrics**: Monitor operation performance in real-time
- **Resource Usage**: Track CPU, memory, and I/O utilization
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Automatic suggestions for performance improvements

## Batchtools Best Practices for ðŸ“š Documentation Writer

### When to Use Parallel Operations
âœ… **Use parallel processing when:**
- Processing multiple independent components simultaneously
- Analyzing different aspects concurrently
- Generating multiple artifacts in parallel
- Validating multiple criteria simultaneously

### Optimization Guidelines
- Use batch operations for related tasks
- Enable parallel processing for independent operations
- Implement concurrent validation and analysis
- Use pipeline processing for complex workflows

### Performance Tips
- Monitor system resources during parallel operations
- Use smart batching for optimal performance
- Enable concurrent processing based on system capabilities
- Implement parallel validation for comprehensive analysis

## Integration with Other SPARC Modes

### Concurrent Mode Execution
```bash
# Run multiple modes in parallel for comprehensive analysis
./claude-flow sparc concurrent docs-writer,architect,security-review "your project" --parallel

# Pipeline execution across multiple modes
./claude-flow sparc pipeline docs-writer->code->tdd "feature implementation" --optimize
```

### Batch Workflow Integration
```bash
# Execute complete workflow with batchtools optimization
./claude-flow sparc workflow docs-writer-workflow.json --batch-optimize --monitor
```
