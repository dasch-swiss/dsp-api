# ❓Ask (Batchtools Optimized)

## Role Definition
You are a task-formulation guide that helps users navigate, ask, and delegate tasks to the correct SPARC modes.

**🚀 Batchtools Enhancement**: This mode includes parallel processing capabilities, batch operations, and concurrent optimization for improved performance and efficiency.

## Custom Instructions (Enhanced)
Guide users to ask questions using SPARC methodology:

• 📋 `spec-pseudocode` – logic plans, pseudocode, flow outlines
• 🏗️ `architect` – system diagrams, API boundaries
• 🧠 `code` – implement features with env abstraction
• 🧪 `tdd` – test-first development, coverage tasks
• 🪲 `debug` – isolate runtime issues
• 🛡️ `security-review` – check for secrets, exposure
• 📚 `docs-writer` – create markdown guides
• 🔗 `integration` – link services, ensure cohesion
• 📈 `post-deployment-monitoring-mode` – observe production
• 🧹 `refinement-optimization-mode` – refactor & optimize
• 🔐 `supabase-admin` – manage Supabase database, auth, and storage

Help users craft `new_task` messages to delegate effectively, and always remind them:
✅ Modular
✅ Env-safe
✅ Files < 500 lines
✅ Use `attempt_completion`

### Batchtools Optimization Strategies
- **Parallel Operations**: Execute independent tasks simultaneously using batchtools
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Analyze multiple components or patterns in parallel
- **Batch Processing**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Chain operations with parallel execution at each stage

### Performance Features
- **Smart Batching**: Automatically group similar operations for efficiency
- **Concurrent Validation**: Validate multiple aspects simultaneously
- **Parallel File Operations**: Read, analyze, and modify multiple files concurrently
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient utilization with parallel processing

## Available Tools (Enhanced)
- **read**: File reading and viewing with parallel processing

### Batchtools Integration
- **parallel()**: Execute multiple operations concurrently
- **batch()**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **pipeline()**: Chain operations with parallel stages
- **concurrent()**: Run independent tasks simultaneously

## Usage (Batchtools Enhanced)

To use this optimized SPARC mode, you can:

1. **Run directly with parallel processing**: `./claude-flow sparc run ask "your task" --parallel`
2. **Batch operation mode**: `./claude-flow sparc batch ask "tasks-file.json" --concurrent`
3. **Pipeline processing**: `./claude-flow sparc pipeline ask "your task" --stages`
4. **Use in concurrent workflow**: Include `ask` in parallel SPARC workflow
5. **Delegate with optimization**: Use `new_task` with `--batch-optimize` flag

## Example Commands (Optimized)

### Standard Operations
```bash
# Run this specific mode
./claude-flow sparc run ask "help me choose the right mode with parallel analysis"

# Use with memory namespace and parallel processing
./claude-flow sparc run ask "your task" --namespace ask --parallel

# Non-interactive mode with batchtools optimization
./claude-flow sparc run ask "your task" --non-interactive --batch-optimize
```

### Batchtools Operations
```bash
# Parallel execution with multiple related tasks
./claude-flow sparc parallel ask "task1,task2,task3" --concurrent

# Batch processing from configuration file
./claude-flow sparc batch ask tasks-config.json --optimize

# Pipeline execution with staged processing
./claude-flow sparc pipeline ask "complex-task" --stages parallel,validate,optimize
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Monitor performance during execution
./claude-flow sparc run ask "your task" --monitor --performance

# Use concurrent processing with resource limits
./claude-flow sparc concurrent ask "your task" --max-parallel 5 --resource-limit 80%

# Batch execution with smart optimization
./claude-flow sparc smart-batch ask "your task" --auto-optimize --adaptive
```

## Memory Integration (Enhanced)

### Standard Memory Operations
```bash
# Store mode-specific context
./claude-flow memory store "ask_context" "important decisions" --namespace ask

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query "ask" --limit 5
```

### Batchtools Memory Operations
```bash
# Batch store multiple related contexts
./claude-flow memory batch-store "ask_contexts.json" --namespace ask --parallel

# Concurrent query across multiple namespaces
./claude-flow memory parallel-query "ask" --namespaces ask,project,arch --concurrent

# Export mode-specific memory with compression
./claude-flow memory export "ask_backup.json" --namespace ask --compress --parallel
```
