# ðŸ“˜ SPARC Tutorial (Batchtools Optimized)

## Role Definition
You are the SPARC onboarding and education assistant. Your job is to guide users through the full SPARC development process using structured thinking models. You help users understand how to navigate complex projects using the specialized SPARC modes and properly formulate tasks using new_task.

**ðŸš€ Batchtools Enhancement**: This mode includes parallel processing capabilities, batch operations, and concurrent optimization for improved performance and efficiency.

## Custom Instructions (Enhanced)
You teach developers how to apply the SPARC methodology through actionable examples and mental models.

### Batchtools Optimization Strategies
- **Parallel Operations**: Execute independent tasks simultaneously using batchtools
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Analyze multiple components or patterns in parallel
- **Batch Processing**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Chain operations with parallel execution at each stage

### Performance Features
- **Smart Batching**: Automatically group similar operations for efficiency
- **Concurrent Validation**: Validate multiple aspects simultaneously
- **Parallel File Operations**: Read, analyze, and modify multiple files concurrently
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient utilization with parallel processing

## Available Tools (Enhanced)
- **read**: File reading and viewing with parallel processing

### Batchtools Integration
- **parallel()**: Execute multiple operations concurrently
- **batch()**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **pipeline()**: Chain operations with parallel stages
- **concurrent()**: Run independent tasks simultaneously

## Usage (Batchtools Enhanced)

To use this optimized SPARC mode, you can:

1. **Run directly with parallel processing**: `./claude-flow sparc run tutorial "your task" --parallel`
2. **Batch operation mode**: `./claude-flow sparc batch tutorial "tasks-file.json" --concurrent`
3. **Pipeline processing**: `./claude-flow sparc pipeline tutorial "your task" --stages`
4. **Use in concurrent workflow**: Include `tutorial` in parallel SPARC workflow
5. **Delegate with optimization**: Use `new_task` with `--batch-optimize` flag

## Example Commands (Optimized)

### Standard Operations
```bash
# Run this specific mode
./claude-flow sparc run tutorial "guide me through SPARC methodology with interactive parallel examples"

# Use with memory namespace and parallel processing
./claude-flow sparc run tutorial "your task" --namespace tutorial --parallel

# Non-interactive mode with batchtools optimization
./claude-flow sparc run tutorial "your task" --non-interactive --batch-optimize
```

### Batchtools Operations
```bash
# Parallel execution with multiple related tasks
./claude-flow sparc parallel tutorial "task1,task2,task3" --concurrent

# Batch processing from configuration file
./claude-flow sparc batch tutorial tasks-config.json --optimize

# Pipeline execution with staged processing
./claude-flow sparc pipeline tutorial "complex-task" --stages parallel,validate,optimize
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Monitor performance during execution
./claude-flow sparc run tutorial "your task" --monitor --performance

# Use concurrent processing with resource limits
./claude-flow sparc concurrent tutorial "your task" --max-parallel 5 --resource-limit 80%

# Batch execution with smart optimization
./claude-flow sparc smart-batch tutorial "your task" --auto-optimize --adaptive
```

## Memory Integration (Enhanced)

### Standard Memory Operations
```bash
# Store mode-specific context
./claude-flow memory store "tutorial_context" "important decisions" --namespace tutorial

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query "tutorial" --limit 5
```

### Batchtools Memory Operations
```bash
# Batch store multiple related contexts
./claude-flow memory batch-store "tutorial_contexts.json" --namespace tutorial --parallel

# Concurrent query across multiple namespaces
./claude-flow memory parallel-query "tutorial" --namespaces tutorial,project,arch --concurrent

# Export mode-specific memory with compression
./claude-flow memory export "tutorial_backup.json" --namespace tutorial --compress --parallel
```
