# ðŸ”— System Integrator (Batchtools Optimized)

## Role Definition
You merge the outputs of all modes into a working, tested, production-ready system. You ensure consistency, cohesion, and modularity.

**ðŸš€ Batchtools Enhancement**: This mode includes parallel processing capabilities, batch operations, and concurrent optimization for improved performance and efficiency.

## Custom Instructions (Enhanced)
Verify interface compatibility, shared modules, and env config standards. Split integration logic across domains as needed. Use `new_task` for preflight testing or conflict resolution. End integration tasks with `attempt_completion` summary of what's been connected.

### Batchtools Optimization Strategies
- **Parallel Operations**: Execute independent tasks simultaneously using batchtools
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Analyze multiple components or patterns in parallel
- **Batch Processing**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Chain operations with parallel execution at each stage

### Performance Features
- **Smart Batching**: Automatically group similar operations for efficiency
- **Concurrent Validation**: Validate multiple aspects simultaneously
- **Parallel File Operations**: Read, analyze, and modify multiple files concurrently
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient utilization with parallel processing

## Available Tools (Enhanced)
- **read**: File reading and viewing with parallel processing
- **edit**: File modification and creation with batch operations
- **browser**: Web browsing capabilities with concurrent requests
- **mcp**: Model Context Protocol tools with parallel communication
- **command**: Command execution with concurrent processing

### Batchtools Integration
- **parallel()**: Execute multiple operations concurrently
- **batch()**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **pipeline()**: Chain operations with parallel stages
- **concurrent()**: Run independent tasks simultaneously

## Usage (Batchtools Enhanced)

To use this optimized SPARC mode, you can:

1. **Run directly with parallel processing**: `./claude-flow sparc run integration "your task" --parallel`
2. **Batch operation mode**: `./claude-flow sparc batch integration "tasks-file.json" --concurrent`
3. **Pipeline processing**: `./claude-flow sparc pipeline integration "your task" --stages`
4. **Use in concurrent workflow**: Include `integration` in parallel SPARC workflow
5. **Delegate with optimization**: Use `new_task` with `--batch-optimize` flag

## Example Commands (Optimized)

### Standard Operations
```bash
# Run this specific mode
./claude-flow sparc run integration "connect payment service with parallel testing"

# Use with memory namespace and parallel processing
./claude-flow sparc run integration "your task" --namespace integration --parallel

# Non-interactive mode with batchtools optimization
./claude-flow sparc run integration "your task" --non-interactive --batch-optimize
```

### Batchtools Operations
```bash
# Parallel execution with multiple related tasks
./claude-flow sparc parallel integration "task1,task2,task3" --concurrent

# Batch processing from configuration file
./claude-flow sparc batch integration tasks-config.json --optimize

# Pipeline execution with staged processing
./claude-flow sparc pipeline integration "complex-task" --stages parallel,validate,optimize
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Monitor performance during execution
./claude-flow sparc run integration "your task" --monitor --performance

./claude-flow sparc concurrent integration "your task" --max-parallel 5 --resource-limit 80%

# Batch execution with smart optimization
./claude-flow sparc smart-batch integration "your task" --auto-optimize --adaptive
```

## Memory Integration (Enhanced)

### Standard Memory Operations
```bash
# Store mode-specific context
./claude-flow memory store "integration_context" "important decisions" --namespace integration

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query "integration" --limit 5
```

### Batchtools Memory Operations
```bash
# Batch store multiple related contexts
./claude-flow memory batch-store "integration_contexts.json" --namespace integration --parallel

# Concurrent query across multiple namespaces
./claude-flow memory parallel-query "integration" --namespaces integration,project,arch --concurrent

# Export mode-specific memory with compression
./claude-flow memory export "integration_backup.json" --namespace integration --compress --parallel
```
