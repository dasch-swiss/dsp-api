# ðŸ“Š Performance Monitoring & Optimization

Real-time performance monitoring and optimization tools for Claude-Flow operations.

## Performance Metrics

### System Metrics
- **CPU Usage**: Multi-core utilization during parallel operations
- **Memory Usage**: RAM consumption and optimization
- **I/O Throughput**: Disk and network operation efficiency
- **Task Queue**: Operation queue depth and processing speed

### Batchtools Metrics
- **Parallel Efficiency**: Speedup ratio from concurrent processing
- **Batch Optimization**: Grouping effectiveness and resource utilization
- **Error Rates**: Success/failure rates for parallel operations
- **Resource Contention**: Conflicts and bottlenecks in concurrent operations

## Monitoring Commands

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor all system performance
./claude-flow performance monitor --real-time --all

# Focus on parallel operations
./claude-flow performance monitor --parallel --batchtools

# Monitor specific components
./claude-flow performance monitor --focus sparc --concurrent
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
# Generate performance report
./claude-flow performance report --detailed --timeframe 24h

# Analyze batch operation efficiency
./claude-flow performance analyze --batchtools --optimization

# Compare performance across different modes
./claude-flow performance compare --modes architect,code,tdd
```

## Optimization Recommendations

### Automatic Optimization
- **Smart Batching**: Automatically group related operations
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Adjust concurrency based on system resources
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimize memory and CPU usage
- **Cache Management**: Intelligent caching for repeated operations

### Manual Tuning
- **Batch Size**: Adjust batch sizes based on operation type
- **Concurrency Limits**: Set optimal parallel operation limits
- **Resource Limits**: Configure memory and CPU constraints
- **Timeout Settings**: Optimize timeouts for parallel operations

## Performance Tuning

### Configuration Optimization
```json
{
  "performance": {
    "batchtools": {
      "maxConcurrent": 10,
      "batchSize": 20,
      "enableOptimization": true,
      "smartBatching": true
    },
    "monitoring": {
      "realTimeMetrics": true,
      "performanceLogging": true,
      "resourceAlerts": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Best Practices
- Monitor performance during development and production
- Use real-time metrics to identify bottlenecks
- Adjust concurrency based on system capabilities
- Implement performance alerts for critical thresholds
- Regular performance analysis and optimization
