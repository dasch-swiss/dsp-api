## Comments

Copied verbatim from `eng/references/comment-conventions.md` in dasch-claude-plugins; change it there, then re-copy.

- A comment states what the reader must not break, never what the session discovered. Test: would it still be true and useful for someone who never saw the change that added it?
- Keep: an invariant a reader would otherwise break, a non-obvious third-party contract (lifetime, ownership, error/return semantics), the public API contract. One or two sentences each.
- Move out: what a change fixed or a test caught → commit body or PR; probe tables, benchmarks, corpus counts → `docs/` or a learning; a rejected alternative → a docs page or ADR, leaving one line and a link in the source.
- Delete: restatements of the code below, history ("previously", "now uses", "was changed to"), and any REQ id, user story, or plan-phase reference. A `TODO` without an issue id belongs in the tracker. A doc comment on an item a caller reaches is not a restatement: it is API surface, measured against what a caller needs rather than against the line below it.
- A PR description describes the code and the diff, never the commit history. "Commit 1 did X, commit 2 fixed Y" describes the journey.
- A "why" longer than about five lines belongs in a file; the comment becomes a pointer to it. A block past ~12 lines is a routing signal.
- Delete by default, when adding and when trimming: per sentence, name what a reader breaks without it, cut the ones with no answer, unclear included, and hold each survivor to one or two sentences.
- Doc comments use Scaladoc (`/** ... */`).
- Formats with no doc-comment tool (yaml, Bazel, shell, TOML, lua, sql) carry the same rule. Exception: a `justfile` recipe's preceding comment is its `just --list` help text, so it is user-facing and stays.
