        # may be quite some time after the request has been received from the
        # application!
        # There are two main reasons to delay the start of the request timeout timer:
        # 1. On the host-level API with pipelining disabled:
        #    If the request cannot be sent immediately because all connections are
        #    currently busy with earlier requests it has to be queued until a
        #    connection becomes available.
        # 2. With pipelining enabled:
        #    The request timeout timer starts only once the response for the
        #    preceding request on the connection has arrived.
        # Set to `infinite` to completely disable request timeouts.
