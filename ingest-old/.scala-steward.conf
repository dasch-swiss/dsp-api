# pullRequests.frequency allows to control how often or when Scala Steward
# is allowed to create pull requests.
#
# Possible values:
#   @asap
#     PRs are created without delay.
#
#   <timespan>
#     PRs are created only again after the given timespan since the last PR
#     has passed. Example values are "36 hours", "1 day", or "14 days".

#   <CRON expression>
#     PRs are created roughly according to the given CRON expression.
#
#     CRON expressions consist of five fields:
#     minutes, hour of day, day of month, month, and day of week.
#
#     See https://www.alonsodomin.me/cron4s/userguide/index.html#parsing for
#     more information about the CRON expressions that are supported.
#
#     Note that the date parts of the CRON expression are matched exactly
#     while the time parts are only used to abide to the frequency of
#     the given expression.
#
# Default: "@asap"
#
# pullRequests.grouping allows you to specify how Scala Steward should group
# your updates in order to reduce the number of pull-requests.
#
# Updates will be placed in the first group with which they match, starting
# from the first in the array. Those that do not match any group will follow
# the default procedure (one PR per update).
#
# Each element in the array will have the following schema:
#
#   - name (mandatory): the name of the group, will be used for things like naming the branch
#   - title (optional): if provided it will be used as the title for the PR
#   - filter (mandatory): a non-empty list containing the filters to use to know
#                         if an update falls into this group.
#
# `filter` properties would have this format:
#
#    {
#       version = "major" | "minor" | "patch" | "pre-release" | "build-metadata",
#       group = "{group}",
#       artifact = "{artifact}"
#    }
#
# For more information on the values for the `version` filter visit https://semver.org/
#
# Every field in a `filter` is optional but at least one must be provided.
#
# For grouping every update together a filter like {group = "*"} can be # provided.
#
# To create a new PR for each unique combination of artifact-versions, include ${hash} in the name.
#
# Default: []
pullRequests.grouping = [
  { name = "patch", "title" = "chore: Patch dependency updates", "filter" = [{"version" = "patch"}] },
  { name = "minor", "title" = "chore: Minor dependency updates", "filter" = [{"version" = "minor"}] },
  { name = "major", "title" = "chore: Major dependency updates", "filter" = [{"version" = "major"}] },
  {name = "all", "title" = "chore: Dependency updates", "filter" = [{"group" = "*"}]}
]

# If set, Scala Steward will use this message template for the commit messages and PR titles.
# Supported variables: ${artifactName}, ${currentVersion}, ${nextVersion} and ${default}
# Default: "${default}" which is equivalent to "Update ${artifactName} to ${nextVersion}"
commits.message = "chore: Update ${artifactName} from ${currentVersion} to ${nextVersion}"
