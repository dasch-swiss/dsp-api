        // text files (in fake-triplestore-query-dir). This is useful for:
        //
        // * measuring the response time of the application minus the response time of the triplestore.
        //
        // * debugging SPARQL queries, because you can open the generated queries in a text editor and copy and paste
        //   them into something like GraphDB Workbench to experiment with them.
        //
        // * benchmarking triplestores, because you can feed the whole fake triplestore file structure to RDFBench.
        //
        // To generate a fake triplestore, set fake-triplestore to "prepare", start the application, and run one or more
        // API operations. The fake triplestore will contain all the SPARQL queries and responses involved in those
        // operations.
        //
        // To have the application use the fake triplestore, set fake-triplestore to "use", and restart the application.
        // The entire contents of the fake triplestore will be loaded when the application starts, and all SPARQL queries
        // will simply be hashtable lookups in this in-memory data.
