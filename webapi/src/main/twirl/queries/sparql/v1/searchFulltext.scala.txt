@*
 * Performs a simple full-text search. The number of rows returned per matching resource is equal to the
 * number of values that matched in the resource, plus one if the resource's label matched.
 *
 * If the triplestore type is GraphDB, this template delegates to searchFulltextGraphDB.sparql.txt, which is optimised
 * for GraphDB. Otherwise, it delegates to searchFulltextStandard.sparql.txt.
 *
 * @param triplestore the name of the triplestore being used.
 * @param searchTerms search terms to be combined with AND in Lucene full-text search syntax.
 * @param preferredLanguage the language code of the user's preferred language.
 * @param fallbackLanguage the language code of the application's default language.
 * @param projectIriOption if filtering by project is desired, the IRI of the project to search.
 * @param restypeIriOption if given, searches only for resources of this class and its subclasses.
