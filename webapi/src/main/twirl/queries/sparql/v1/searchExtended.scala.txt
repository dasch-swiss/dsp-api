@**
 * Performs an extended search. The number of rows returned per matching resource is the product of the number of
 * values that each search criterion matched in the resource.
 *
 * If the triplestore type is GraphDB, this template delegates to searchExtendedGraphDB.sparql.txt, which is optimised
 * for GraphDB. Otherwise, it delegates to searchExtendedStandard.sparql.txt.
 *
 * @param triplestore the name of the triplestore being used.
 * @param searchCriteria a list of maps containing search criteria, each of which contains:
 * @param preferredLanguage the language code of the user's preferred language.
 * @param fallbackLanguage the language code of the application's default language.
 * @param projectIriOption if filtering by project is desired, the IRI of the project to search.
 * @param restypeIriOption if given, returns only resources of this class and its subclasses.
 * @param ownerIriOption if filtering by owner is desired, the IRI of the resource owner to search for.
