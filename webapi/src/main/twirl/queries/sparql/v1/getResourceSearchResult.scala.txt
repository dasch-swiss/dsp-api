 * Performs a search for resources matching the given criteria.
 *
 * If the triplestore type is GraphDB, this template delegates to getResourceSearchResultGraphDB.sparql.txt, which is
 * optimised for GraphDB. Otherwise, it delegates to getResourceSearchResultStandard.sparql.txt.
 *
 * @param triplestore the name of the triplestore being used.
 * @param phrase the search phrase (e.g. "Reise ins").
 * @param lastTerm the last search term (e.g. "Heili").
 * @param resourceTypeIri if set, restricts search to this resource class and its subclasses.
 * @param numberOfProps the amount of describing properties to be returned for each found resource (e.g if set to two,
 *                      for an incunabula book its title and creator would be returned).
 * @param limitOfResults limits number of resources to be returned.
 * @param separator the separator to be used when concatenating the value strings.
