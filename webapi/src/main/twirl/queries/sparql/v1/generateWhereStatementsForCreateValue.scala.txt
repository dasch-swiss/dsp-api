@**
 * Generates statements to be added to the WHERE clause of a SPARQL update when creating a new value of a resource
 * property (as opposed to a new version of an existing value). This template is used in two contexts: when creating a
 * single value in an existing resource, and when creating a new resource with its initial values.
 *
 * @param resourceIndex the index of the resource
 * @param valueIndex the index of the value in the sequence of values that are being created in the transaction (can
 *                   be 0 if only one value is being created). This index will be used to make SPARQL variable names
 *                   specific to the value being created.
 * @param resourceIri the resource to update.
 * @param propertyIri the resource property to update.
 * @param newValueIri the new value IRI.
 * @param valueTypeIri the type of the new value.
 * @param linkUpdates a list of [[LinkUpdate]] objects describing links and LinkValues that need to be
 *        updated for resource references in Standoff text values. This list will be empty if the links and LinkValues
 *        are being created separately.
 * @param maybeValueHasOrder an optional value for the knora-base:valueHasOrder predicate of the new value. If not
 *                           provided, the value of this predicate will be calculated using a subquery.
 *
 * The SPARQL variables `?resource` and `?resourceClass` must already be bound.

    Bind a variable for knora-base:valueHasOrder for the new value.

    If this template is being used to create a single value, maybeValueHasOrder will be None, and we have to do a subquery
    to determine the next available knora-base:valueHasOrder. This works as follows: if the property already has one or more
    (non-deleted) values in the resource, find the one with the highest order, add 1 to its order, and give the resulting
    order to the new value. Otherwise, give the new value an order of 0.

    If this template is being used to create a new resource with its initial values, there are no existing values to query in
    the resource, and maybeValueHasOrder will contain the knora-base:valueHasOrder to be used.
