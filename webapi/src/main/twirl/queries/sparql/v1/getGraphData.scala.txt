 * Gets the outbound or inbound links from/to a resource. This query is used recursively to get a graph of
 * resources reachable from a given resource.
 *
 * If the triplestore type is GraphDB, this template delegates to getGraphDataGraphDB.sparql.txt, which is optimised
 * for GraphDB. Otherwise, it delegates to getGraphDataStandard.sparql.txt.
 *
 * @param triplestore the name of the triplestore being used.
 * @param startNodeIri the IRI of the resource to use as the starting point of the query.
 * @param startNodeOnly if true, returns information only about the start node.
 * @param outbound true to get outbound links, false to get inbound links.
