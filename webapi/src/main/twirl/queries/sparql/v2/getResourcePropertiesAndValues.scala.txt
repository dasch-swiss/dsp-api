 * Gets the values of all the Knora properties of a resource.

 * which is optimised for GraphDB. Otherwise, it delegates to getResourcePropertiesAndValuesStandard.sparql.txt.

 * @param triplestore the name of the triplestore being used.
 * @param resourceIris the IRIs of the resources to be queried.
 * @param preview indicates if the request should only return preview information.
