 * If the triplestore type is GraphDB, this template delegates to searchFulltextGraphDB.sparql.txt, which is optimised

 *
 * @param triplestore the name of the triplestore being used.
 * @param searchTerms search terms.
 * @param limitToProject limit search to the given project.
 * @param limitToResourceClass limit search to given resource class.
 * @param separator the separator to be used in aggregation functions.
 * @param limit maximal amount of rows to be returned
 * @param offset offset for paging (starts with 0)
 * @param countQuery indicates whether it is a count query or the actual resources should be returned.
