@*
 * Performs a simple full-text search using standard SPARQL (except for the interface to Lucene, which is
 * triplestore-specific), and without inference.
 *
 * The number of rows returned per matching resource is equal to the number of values that matched in the resource,
 * plus one if the resource's label matched.
 *
 * This template is used only by searchFulltext.scala.txt.
 *
 * @param triplestore the name of the triplestore being used.
 * @param searchTerms search terms.
 * @param limitToProject limit search to the given project.
 * @param limitToResourceClass limit search to given resource class.
 * @param separator the separator to be used in aggregation functions.
 * @param limit maximal amount of rows to be returned
 * @param offset offset for paging (starts with 0)
 * @param countQuery indicates whether it is a count query or the actual resources should be returned.
