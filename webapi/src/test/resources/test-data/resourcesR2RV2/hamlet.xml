<h3>ACT I</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.</h3>
<blockquote>
<em>FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Who's there?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>FRANCISCO</strong>
<blockquote>
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Long live the king!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>FRANCISCO</strong>
<blockquote>
Bernardo?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
He.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>FRANCISCO</strong>
<blockquote>
You come most carefully upon your hour.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>FRANCISCO</strong>
<blockquote>
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,<br/>
And I am sick at heart.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Have you had quiet guard?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>FRANCISCO</strong>
<blockquote>
Not a mouse stirring.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Well, good night.<br/>
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,<br/>
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>FRANCISCO</strong>
<blockquote>
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?<br/>
<p><em>Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Friends to this ground.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
And liegemen to the Dane.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>FRANCISCO</strong>
<blockquote>
Give you good night.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
O, farewell, honest soldier:<br/>
Who hath relieved you?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>FRANCISCO</strong>
<blockquote>
Bernardo has my place.<br/>
Give you good night.<br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Holla! Bernardo!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Say,<br/>
What, is Horatio there?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
A piece of him.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
I have seen nothing.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,<br/>
And will not let belief take hold of him<br/>
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:<br/>
Therefore I have entreated him along<br/>
With us to watch the minutes of this night;<br/>
That if again this apparition come,<br/>
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Sit down awhile;<br/>
And let us once again assail your ears,<br/>
That are so fortified against our story<br/>
What we have two nights seen.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Well, sit we down,<br/>
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Last night of all,<br/>
When yond same star that's westward from the pole<br/>
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven<br/>
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,<br/>
The bell then beating one,--<br/>
<p><em>Enter Ghost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
It would be spoke to.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Question it, Horatio.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,<br/>
Together with that fair and warlike form<br/>
In which the majesty of buried Denmark<br/>
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
It is offended.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
                  See, it stalks away!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!<br/>
<p><em>Exit Ghost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
'Tis gone, and will not answer.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:<br/>
Is not this something more than fantasy?<br/>
What think you on't?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Before my God, I might not this believe<br/>
Without the sensible and true avouch<br/>
Of mine own eyes.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
                  Is it not like the king?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
As thou art to thyself:<br/>
Such was the very armour he had on<br/>
When he the ambitious Norway combated;<br/>
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,<br/>
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.<br/>
'Tis strange.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,<br/>
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
In what particular thought to work I know not;<br/>
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br/>
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,<br/>
Why this same strict and most observant watch<br/>
So nightly toils the subject of the land,<br/>
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,<br/>
And foreign mart for implements of war;<br/>
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task<br/>
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;<br/>
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste<br/>
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:<br/>
Who is't that can inform me?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
That can I;<br/>
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,<br/>
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,<br/>
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br/>
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,<br/>
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--<br/>
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--<br/>
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,<br/>
Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br/>
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands<br/>
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:<br/>
Against the which, a moiety competent<br/>
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd<br/>
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br/>
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,<br/>
And carriage of the article design'd,<br/>
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br/>
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,<br/>
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there<br/>
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,<br/>
For food and diet, to some enterprise<br/>
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--<br/>
As it doth well appear unto our state--<br/>
But to recover of us, by strong hand<br/>
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br/>
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,<br/>
Is the main motive of our preparations,<br/>
The source of this our watch and the chief head<br/>
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
I think it be no other but e'en so:<br/>
Well may it sort that this portentous figure<br/>
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king<br/>
That was and is the question of these wars.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.<br/>
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br/>
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br/>
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead<br/>
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:<br/>
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,<br/>
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star<br/>
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands<br/>
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:<br/>
And even the like precurse of fierce events,<br/>
As harbingers preceding still the fates<br/>
And prologue to the omen coming on,<br/>
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br/>
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--<br/>
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!<br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Ghost</em></p>
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!<br/>
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,<br/>
Speak to me:<br/>
If there be any good thing to be done,<br/>
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,<br/>
Speak to me:<br/>
<p><em>Cock crows</em></p>
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,<br/>
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!<br/>
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life<br/>
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,<br/>
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,<br/>
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Do, if it will not stand.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
'Tis here!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
'Tis here!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
'Tis gone!<br/>
<p><em>Exit Ghost</em></p>
We do it wrong, being so majestical,<br/>
To offer it the show of violence;<br/>
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,<br/>
And our vain blows malicious mockery.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
And then it started like a guilty thing<br/>
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,<br/>
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,<br/>
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat<br/>
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,<br/>
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,<br/>
The extravagant and erring spirit hies<br/>
To his confine: and of the truth herein<br/>
This present object made probation.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
It faded on the crowing of the cock.<br/>
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes<br/>
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,<br/>
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:<br/>
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;<br/>
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,<br/>
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,<br/>
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
So have I heard and do in part believe it.<br/>
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,<br/>
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:<br/>
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,<br/>
Let us impart what we have seen to-night<br/>
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,<br/>
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.<br/>
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,<br/>
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know<br/>
Where we shall find him most conveniently.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.</h3>
<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,  POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death<br/>
The memory be green, and that it us befitted<br/>
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom<br/>
To be contracted in one brow of woe,<br/>
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature<br/>
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,<br/>
Together with remembrance of ourselves.<br/>
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,<br/>
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,<br/>
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--<br/>
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,<br/>
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,<br/>
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--<br/>
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd<br/>
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone<br/>
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.<br/>
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,<br/>
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,<br/>
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death<br/>
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,<br/>
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,<br/>
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,<br/>
Importing the surrender of those lands<br/>
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,<br/>
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.<br/>
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:<br/>
Thus much the business is: we have here writ<br/>
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--<br/>
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears<br/>
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress<br/>
His further gait herein; in that the levies,<br/>
The lists and full proportions, are all made<br/>
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch<br/>
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,<br/>
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;<br/>
Giving to you no further personal power<br/>
To business with the king, more than the scope<br/>
Of these delated articles allow.<br/>
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>CORNELIUS</strong>

<strong>VOLTIMAND</strong>
<blockquote>
In that and all things will we show our duty.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</em></p>
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?<br/>
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?<br/>
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,<br/>
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,<br/>
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?<br/>
The head is not more native to the heart,<br/>
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,<br/>
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.<br/>
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
My dread lord,<br/>
Your leave and favour to return to France;<br/>
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,<br/>
To show my duty in your coronation,<br/>
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,<br/>
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France<br/>
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave<br/>
By laboursome petition, and at last<br/>
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:<br/>
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,<br/>
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!<br/>
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,<br/>
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.<br/>
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids<br/>
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:<br/>
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,<br/>
Passing through nature to eternity.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, madam, it is common.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
If it be,<br/>
Why seems it so particular with thee?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'<br/>
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,<br/>
Nor customary suits of solemn black,<br/>
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,<br/>
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,<br/>
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,<br/>
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,<br/>
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,<br/>
For they are actions that a man might play:<br/>
But I have that within which passeth show;<br/>
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,<br/>
To give these mourning duties to your father:<br/>
But, you must know, your father lost a father;<br/>
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound<br/>
In filial obligation for some term<br/>
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever<br/>
In obstinate condolement is a course<br/>
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;<br/>
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,<br/>
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,<br/>
An understanding simple and unschool'd:<br/>
For what we know must be and is as common<br/>
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,<br/>
Why should we in our peevish opposition<br/>
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,<br/>
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,<br/>
To reason most absurd: whose common theme<br/>
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,<br/>
From the first corse till he that died to-day,<br/>
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth<br/>
This unprevailing woe, and think of us<br/>
As of a father: for let the world take note,<br/>
You are the most immediate to our throne;<br/>
And with no less nobility of love<br/>
Than that which dearest father bears his son,<br/>
Do I impart toward you. For your intent<br/>
In going back to school in Wittenberg,<br/>
It is most retrograde to our desire:<br/>
And we beseech you, bend you to remain<br/>
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,<br/>
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:<br/>
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:<br/>
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;<br/>
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet<br/>
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,<br/>
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,<br/>
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,<br/>
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,<br/>
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but HAMLET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt<br/>
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!<br/>
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd<br/>
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!<br/>
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,<br/>
Seem to me all the uses of this world!<br/>
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,<br/>
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature<br/>
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!<br/>
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:<br/>
So excellent a king; that was, to this,<br/>
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother<br/>
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven<br/>
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!<br/>
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,<br/>
As if increase of appetite had grown<br/>
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--<br/>
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--<br/>
A little month, or ere those shoes were old<br/>
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,<br/>
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--<br/>
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,<br/>
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,<br/>
My father's brother, but no more like my father<br/>
Than I to Hercules: within a month:<br/>
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears<br/>
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,<br/>
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post<br/>
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!<br/>
It is not nor it cannot come to good:<br/>
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.<br/>
<p><em>Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Hail to your lordship!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I am glad to see you well:<br/>
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:<br/>
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
My good lord--<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.<br/>
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
A truant disposition, good my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I would not hear your enemy say so,<br/>
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,<br/>
To make it truster of your own report<br/>
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.<br/>
But what is your affair in Elsinore?<br/>
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;<br/>
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats<br/>
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.<br/>
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven<br/>
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!<br/>
My father!--methinks I see my father.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Where, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
                  In my mind's eye, Horatio.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
He was a man, take him for all in all,<br/>
I shall not look upon his like again.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Saw? who?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, the king your father.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
The king my father!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Season your admiration for awhile<br/>
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,<br/>
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,<br/>
This marvel to you.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
For God's love, let me hear.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Two nights together had these gentlemen,<br/>
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,<br/>
In the dead vast and middle of the night,<br/>
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,<br/>
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,<br/>
Appears before them, and with solemn march<br/>
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd<br/>
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,<br/>
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled<br/>
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,<br/>
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me<br/>
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;<br/>
And I with them the third night kept the watch;<br/>
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,<br/>
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,<br/>
The apparition comes: I knew your father;<br/>
These hands are not more like.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
But where was this?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Did you not speak to it?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, I did;<br/>
But answer made it none: yet once methought<br/>
It lifted up its head and did address<br/>
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;<br/>
But even then the morning cock crew loud,<br/>
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,<br/>
And vanish'd from our sight.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
'Tis very strange.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;<br/>
And we did think it writ down in our duty<br/>
To let you know of it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.<br/>
Hold you the watch to-night?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
We do, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Arm'd, say you?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Arm'd, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
From top to toe?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, from head to foot.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Then saw you not his face?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
What, look'd he frowningly?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Pale or red?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Nay, very pale.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
                  And fix'd his eyes upon you?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Most constantly.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
                  I would I had been there.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
It would have much amazed you.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>

<strong>BERNARDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Longer, longer.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Not when I saw't.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
                  His beard was grizzled--no?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
It was, as I have seen it in his life,<br/>
A sable silver'd.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
                  I will watch to-night;<br/>

If it assume my noble father's person,<br/>
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape<br/>

If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,<br/>
Let it be tenable in your silence still;<br/>
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,<br/>
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:<br/>
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:<br/>

Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,<br/>
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.<br/>

<h3>SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.</h3>
<blockquote>
<em>Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:<br/>
And, sister, as the winds give benefit<br/>
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,<br/>
But let me hear from you.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
Do you doubt that?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,<br/>
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,<br/>
A violet in the youth of primy nature,<br/>
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,<br/>
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
       No more but so?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Think it no more;<br/>
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone<br/>
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,<br/>
The inward service of the mind and soul<br/>
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,<br/>
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch<br/>
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,<br/>
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;<br/>
For he himself is subject to his birth:<br/>
He may not, as unvalued persons do,<br/>
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends<br/>
The safety and health of this whole state;<br/>
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed<br/>
Unto the voice and yielding of that body<br/>
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,<br/>
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br/>
As he in his particular act and place<br/>
May give his saying deed; which is no further<br/>
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br/>
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,<br/>
If with too credent ear you list his songs,<br/>
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open<br/>
To his unmaster'd importunity.<br/>
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,<br/>
And keep you in the rear of your affection,<br/>
Out of the shot and danger of desire.<br/>
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,<br/>
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:<br/>
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:<br/>
The canker galls the infants of the spring,<br/>
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,<br/>
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth<br/>
Contagious blastments are most imminent.<br/>
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:<br/>
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,<br/>
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,<br/>
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,<br/>
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;<br/>
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,<br/>
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,<br/>
And recks not his own rede.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
O, fear me not.<br/>
I stay too long: but here my father comes.<br/>
<p><em>Enter POLONIUS</em></p>
A double blessing is a double grace,<br/>
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!<br/>
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,<br/>
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!<br/>
And these few precepts in thy memory<br/>
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,<br/>
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.<br/>
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.<br/>
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<br/>
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;<br/>
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment<br/>
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware<br/>
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,<br/>
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.<br/>
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;<br/>
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.<br/>
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br/>
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;<br/>
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,<br/>
And they in France of the best rank and station<br/>
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.<br/>
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;<br/>
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br/>
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br/>
This above all: to thine ownself be true,<br/>
And it must follow, as the night the day,<br/>
Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br/>
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well<br/>
What I have said to you.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
'Tis in my memory lock'd,<br/>
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Farewell.<br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Marry, well bethought:<br/>
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late<br/>
Given private time to you; and you yourself<br/>
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:<br/>
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,<br/>
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,<br/>
You do not understand yourself so clearly<br/>
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.<br/>
What is between you? give me up the truth.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders<br/>
Of his affection to me.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,<br/>
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.<br/>
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;<br/>
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,<br/>
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;<br/>
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,<br/>
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, he hath importuned me with love<br/>
In honourable fashion.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,<br/>
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,<br/>
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul<br/>
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,<br/>
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,<br/>
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,<br/>
You must not take for fire. From this time<br/>
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;<br/>
Set your entreatments at a higher rate<br/>
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,<br/>
Believe so much in him, that he is young<br/>
And with a larger tether may he walk<br/>
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,<br/>
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,<br/>
Not of that dye which their investments show,<br/>
But mere implorators of unholy suits,<br/>
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,<br/>
The better to beguile. This is for all:<br/>
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,<br/>
Have you so slander any moment leisure,<br/>
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.<br/>
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
I shall obey, my lord.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>SCENE IV. The platform.</h3>
<blockquote>
<em>Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
It is a nipping and an eager air.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
What hour now?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
                  I think it lacks of twelve.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
No, it is struck.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season<br/>
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.<br/>
<p><em>A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within</em></p>
What does this mean, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,<br/>
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;<br/>
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,<br/>
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out<br/>
The triumph of his pledge.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Is it a custom?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, marry, is't:<br/>
But to my mind, though I am native here<br/>
And to the manner born, it is a custom<br/>
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.<br/>
This heavy-headed revel east and west<br/>
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:<br/>
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase<br/>
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes<br/>
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,<br/>
The pith and marrow of our attribute.<br/>
So, oft it chances in particular men,<br/>
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,<br/>
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,<br/>
Since nature cannot choose his origin--<br/>
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,<br/>
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,<br/>
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens<br/>
The form of plausive manners, that these men,<br/>
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,<br/>
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--<br/>
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,<br/>
As infinite as man may undergo--<br/>
Shall in the general censure take corruption<br/>
From that particular fault: the dram of eale<br/>
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt<br/>
To his own scandal.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Look, my lord, it comes!<br/>
<p><em>Enter Ghost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!<br/>
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,<br/>
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,<br/>
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,<br/>
Thou comest in such a questionable shape<br/>
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,<br/>
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!<br/>
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell<br/>
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,<br/>
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,<br/>
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,<br/>
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,<br/>
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,<br/>
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel<br/>
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,<br/>
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature<br/>
So horridly to shake our disposition<br/>
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?<br/>
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?<br/>
<p><em>Ghost beckons HAMLET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
It beckons you to go away with it,<br/>
As if it some impartment did desire<br/>
To you alone.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
                  Look, with what courteous action<br/>
It waves you to a more removed ground:<br/>
But do not go with it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
No, by no means.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
It will not speak; then I will follow it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Do not, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
                  Why, what should be the fear?<br/>
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;<br/>
And for my soul, what can it do to that,<br/>
Being a thing immortal as itself?<br/>
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,<br/>
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff<br/>
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,<br/>
And there assume some other horrible form,<br/>
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason<br/>
And draw you into madness? think of it:<br/>
The very place puts toys of desperation,<br/>
Without more motive, into every brain<br/>
That looks so many fathoms to the sea<br/>
And hears it roar beneath.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
It waves me still.<br/>
Go on; I'll follow thee.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
You shall not go, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Hold off your hands.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Be ruled; you shall not go.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
My fate cries out,<br/>
And makes each petty artery in this body<br/>
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.<br/>
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.<br/>
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!<br/>
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
He waxes desperate with imagination.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Have after. To what issue will this come?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Heaven will direct it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>MARCELLUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Nay, let's follow him.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>SCENE V. Another part of the platform.</h3>
<blockquote>
<em>Enter GHOST and HAMLET</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Ghost</strong>
<blockquote>
Mark me.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
       I will.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Ghost</strong>
<blockquote>
                  My hour is almost come,<br/>
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames<br/>
Must render up myself.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Alas, poor ghost!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Ghost</strong>
<blockquote>
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing<br/>
To what I shall unfold.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Speak; I am bound to hear.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Ghost</strong>
<blockquote>
 So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
What?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Ghost</strong>
<blockquote>
I am thy father's spirit,<br/>
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,<br/>
And for the day confined to fast in fires,<br/>
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature<br/>
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid<br/>
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,<br/>
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word<br/>
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,<br/>
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,<br/>
Thy knotted and combined locks to part<br/>
And each particular hair to stand on end,<br/>
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:<br/>
But this eternal blazon must not be<br/>
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!<br/>
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
O God!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Ghost</strong>
<blockquote>
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Murder!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Ghost</strong>
<blockquote>
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;<br/>
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift<br/>
As meditation or the thoughts of love,<br/>
May sweep to my revenge.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Ghost</strong>
<blockquote>
I find thee apt;<br/>
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed<br/>
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,<br/>
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:<br/>
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,<br/>
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark<br/>
Is by a forged process of my death<br/>
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,<br/>
The serpent that did sting thy father's life<br/>
Now wears his crown.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Ghost</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,<br/>
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--<br/>
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power<br/>
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust<br/>
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:<br/>
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!<br/>
From me, whose love was of that dignity<br/>
That it went hand in hand even with the vow<br/>
I made to her in marriage, and to decline<br/>
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor<br/>
To those of mine!<br/>
But virtue, as it never will be moved,<br/>
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,<br/>
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,<br/>
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,<br/>
And prey on garbage.<br/>
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;<br/>
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,<br/>
My custom always of the afternoon,<br/>
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,<br/>
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,<br/>
And in the porches of my ears did pour<br/>
The leperous distilment; whose effect<br/>
Holds such an enmity with blood of man<br/>
That swift as quicksilver it courses through<br/>
The natural gates and alleys of the body,<br/>
And with a sudden vigour doth posset<br/>
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,<br/>
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;<br/>
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,<br/>
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,<br/>
All my smooth body.<br/>
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand<br/>
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:<br/>
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,<br/>
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,<br/>
No reckoning made, but sent to my account<br/>
With all my imperfections on my head:<br/>
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!<br/>
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;<br/>
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be<br/>
A couch for luxury and damned incest.<br/>
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,<br/>
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive<br/>
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven<br/>
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,<br/>
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!<br/>
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,<br/>
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:<br/>
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.<br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?<br/>
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;<br/>
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,<br/>
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!<br/>
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat<br/>
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!<br/>
Yea, from the table of my memory<br/>
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,<br/>
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,<br/>
That youth and observation copied there;<br/>
And thy commandment all alone shall live<br/>
Within the book and volume of my brain,<br/>
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!<br/>
O most pernicious woman!<br/>
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!<br/>
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,<br/>
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;<br/>
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:<br/>
<p><em>Writing</em></p>
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;<br/>
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'<br/>
I have sworn 't.<br/>

Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,<br/>
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,<br/>
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet<br/>
To put an antic disposition on,<br/>
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,<br/>
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,<br/>

Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'<br/>
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note<br/>
That you know aught of me: this not to do,<br/>
So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>

Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!<br/>
<p><em>They swear</em></p>
So, gentlemen,<br/>
With all my love I do commend me to you:<br/>
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is<br/>
May do, to express his love and friending to you,<br/>
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;<br/>
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.<br/>

Nay, come, let's go together.<br/>

<h3>ACT II</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house.</h3>
<blockquote>
<em>Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>REYNALDO</strong>
<blockquote>
I will, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,<br/>
Before you visit him, to make inquire<br/>
Of his behavior.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>REYNALDO</strong>
<blockquote>
                  My lord, I did intend it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,<br/>
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;<br/>
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,<br/>
What company, at what expense; and finding<br/>
By this encompassment and drift of question<br/>
That they do know my son, come you more nearer<br/>
Than your particular demands will touch it:<br/>
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;<br/>
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,<br/>
And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>REYNALDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, very well, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:<br/>
But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;<br/>
Addicted so and so:' and there put on him<br/>
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank<br/>
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;<br/>
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips<br/>
As are companions noted and most known<br/>
To youth and liberty.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>REYNALDO</strong>
<blockquote>
As gaming, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,<br/>
Drabbing: you may go so far.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>REYNALDO</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, that would dishonour him.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge<br/>
You must not put another scandal on him,<br/>
That he is open to incontinency;<br/>
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly<br/>
That they may seem the taints of liberty,<br/>
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,<br/>
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,<br/>
Of general assault.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>REYNALDO</strong>
<blockquote>
But, my good lord,--<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Wherefore should you do this?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>REYNALDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, my lord,<br/>
I would know that.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
                  Marry, sir, here's my drift;<br/>
And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:<br/>
You laying these slight sullies on my son,<br/>
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,<br/>
Your party in converse, him you would sound,<br/>
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes<br/>
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured<br/>
He closes with you in this consequence;<br/>
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'<br/>
According to the phrase or the addition<br/>
Of man and country.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>REYNALDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Very good, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I<br/>
about to say? By the mass, I was about to say<br/>
something: where did I leave?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>REYNALDO</strong>
<blockquote>
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'<br/>
and 'gentleman.'<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;<br/>
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;<br/>
I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,<br/>
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,<br/>
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;<br/>
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,<br/>
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'<br/>
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.<br/>
See you now;<br/>
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:<br/>
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,<br/>
With windlasses and with assays of bias,<br/>
By indirections find directions out:<br/>
So by my former lecture and advice,<br/>
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>REYNALDO</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, I have.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
                  God be wi' you; fare you well.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>REYNALDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Good my lord!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Observe his inclination in yourself.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>REYNALDO</strong>
<blockquote>
I shall, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
And let him ply his music.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>REYNALDO</strong>
<blockquote>
Well, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Farewell!<br/>
<p><em>Exit REYNALDO</em></p>
<p><em>Enter OPHELIA</em></p>
How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
With what, i' the name of God?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,<br/>
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;<br/>
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,<br/>
Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;<br/>
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;<br/>
And with a look so piteous in purport<br/>
As if he had been loosed out of hell<br/>
To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Mad for thy love?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
                  My lord, I do not know;<br/>
But truly, I do fear it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
What said he?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;<br/>
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;<br/>
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,<br/>
He falls to such perusal of my face<br/>
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;<br/>
At last, a little shaking of mine arm<br/>
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,<br/>
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound<br/>
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk<br/>
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:<br/>
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,<br/>
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;<br/>
For out o' doors he went without their helps,<br/>
And, to the last, bended their light on me.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.<br/>
This is the very ecstasy of love,<br/>
Whose violent property fordoes itself<br/>
And leads the will to desperate undertakings<br/>
As oft as any passion under heaven<br/>
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.<br/>
What, have you given him any hard words of late?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
No, my good lord, but, as you did command,<br/>
I did repel his fetters and denied<br/>
His access to me.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
                  That hath made him mad.<br/>
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment<br/>
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,<br/>
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!<br/>
By heaven, it is as proper to our age<br/>
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions<br/>
As it is common for the younger sort<br/>
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:<br/>
This must be known; which, being kept close, might<br/>
move<br/>
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>SCENE II. A room in the castle.</h3>
<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!<br/>
Moreover that we much did long to see you,<br/>
The need we have to use you did provoke<br/>
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard<br/>
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,<br/>
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man<br/>
Resembles that it was. What it should be,<br/>
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him<br/>
So much from the understanding of himself,<br/>
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,<br/>
That, being of so young days brought up with him,<br/>
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,<br/>
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court<br/>
Some little time: so by your companies<br/>
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,<br/>
So much as from occasion you may glean,<br/>
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,<br/>
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;<br/>
And sure I am two men there are not living<br/>
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you<br/>
To show us so much gentry and good will<br/>
As to expend your time with us awhile,<br/>
For the supply and profit of our hope,<br/>
Your visitation shall receive such thanks<br/>
As fits a king's remembrance.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Both your majesties<br/>
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,<br/>
Put your dread pleasures more into command<br/>
Than to entreaty.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
                  But we both obey,<br/>
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent<br/>
To lay our service freely at your feet,<br/>
To be commanded.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:<br/>
And I beseech you instantly to visit<br/>
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,<br/>
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
Heavens make our presence and our practises<br/>
Pleasant and helpful to him!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, amen!<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants</em></p>
<p><em>Enter POLONIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,<br/>
Are joyfully return'd.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Thou still hast been the father of good news.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,<br/>
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,<br/>
Both to my God and to my gracious king:<br/>
And I do think, or else this brain of mine<br/>
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure<br/>
As it hath used to do, that I have found<br/>
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;<br/>
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.<br/>
<p><em>Exit POLONIUS</em></p>
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found<br/>
The head and source of all your son's distemper.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
I doubt it is no other but the main;<br/>
His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Well, we shall sift him.<br/>
<p><em>Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</em></p>
Welcome, my good friends!<br/>
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>VOLTIMAND</strong>
<blockquote>
Most fair return of greetings and desires.<br/>
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress<br/>
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd<br/>
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;<br/>
But, better look'd into, he truly found<br/>
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,<br/>
That so his sickness, age and impotence<br/>
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests<br/>
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;<br/>
Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine<br/>
Makes vow before his uncle never more<br/>
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.<br/>
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,<br/>
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,<br/>
And his commission to employ those soldiers,<br/>
So levied as before, against the Polack:<br/>
With an entreaty, herein further shown,<br/>
<p><em>Giving a paper</em></p>
That it might please you to give quiet pass<br/>
Through your dominions for this enterprise,<br/>
On such regards of safety and allowance<br/>
As therein are set down.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
It likes us well;<br/>
And at our more consider'd time well read,<br/>
Answer, and think upon this business.<br/>
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:<br/>
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:<br/>
Most welcome home!<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
                  This business is well ended.<br/>
My liege, and madam, to expostulate<br/>
What majesty should be, what duty is,<br/>
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,<br/>
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.<br/>
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,<br/>
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,<br/>
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:<br/>
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,<br/>
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?<br/>
But let that go.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
                  More matter, with less art.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.<br/>
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;<br/>
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;<br/>
But farewell it, for I will use no art.<br/>
Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains<br/>
That we find out the cause of this effect,<br/>
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,<br/>
For this effect defective comes by cause:<br/>
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.<br/>
I have a daughter--have while she is mine--<br/>
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,<br/>
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.<br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most<br/>
beautified Ophelia,'--<br/>
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is<br/>
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:<br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
'In her excellent white bosom, these,  &amp; c.'<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
Came this from Hamlet to her?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.<br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
'Doubt thou the stars are fire;<br/>
Doubt that the sun doth move;<br/>
Doubt truth to be a liar;<br/>
But never doubt I love.<br/>
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;<br/>
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that<br/>
I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.<br/>
'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst<br/>
this machine is to him, HAMLET.'<br/>
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,<br/>
And more above, hath his solicitings,<br/>
As they fell out by time, by means and place,<br/>
All given to mine ear.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
But how hath she<br/>
Received his love?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
                  What do you think of me?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
As of a man faithful and honourable.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,<br/>
When I had seen this hot love on the wing--<br/>
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,<br/>
Before my daughter told me--what might you,<br/>
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,<br/>
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,<br/>
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,<br/>
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;<br/>
What might you think? No, I went round to work,<br/>
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:<br/>
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;<br/>
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,<br/>
That she should lock herself from his resort,<br/>
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.<br/>
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;<br/>
And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--<br/>
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,<br/>
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,<br/>
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,<br/>
Into the madness wherein now he raves,<br/>
And all we mourn for.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Do you think 'tis this?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
It may be, very likely.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--<br/>
That I have positively said 'Tis so,'<br/>
When it proved otherwise?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Not that I know.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
[Pointing to his head and shoulder]<br/>
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:<br/>
If circumstances lead me, I will find<br/>
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed<br/>
Within the centre.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
                  How may we try it further?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
You know, sometimes he walks four hours together<br/>
Here in the lobby.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
                  So he does indeed.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:<br/>
Be you and I behind an arras then;<br/>
Mark the encounter: if he love her not<br/>
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,<br/>
Let me be no assistant for a state,<br/>
But keep a farm and carters.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
We will try it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Away, I do beseech you, both away:<br/>
I'll board him presently.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants</em></p>
<p><em>Enter HAMLET, reading</em></p>
O, give me leave:<br/>
How does my good Lord Hamlet?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Well, God-a-mercy.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Do you know me, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Not I, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Then I would you were so honest a man.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Honest, my lord!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be<br/>
one man picked out of ten thousand.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
That's very true, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a<br/>
god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
I have, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a<br/>
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.<br/>
Friend, look to 't.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
[Aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on my<br/>
daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I<br/>
was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and<br/>
truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for<br/>
love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.<br/>
What do you read, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Words, words, words.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
What is the matter, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Between who?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here<br/>
that old men have grey beards, that their faces are<br/>
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and<br/>
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of<br/>
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,<br/>
though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet<br/>
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for<br/>
yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab<br/>
you could go backward.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
[Aside]  Though this be madness, yet there is method<br/>
in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Into my grave.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Indeed, that is out o' the air.<br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness<br/>
that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity<br/>
could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will<br/>
leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of<br/>
meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable<br/>
lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will<br/>
more willingly part withal: except my life, except<br/>
my life, except my life.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Fare you well, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
These tedious old fools!<br/>
<p><em>Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
[To POLONIUS]  God save you, sir!<br/>
<p><em>Exit POLONIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
My honoured lord!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
My most dear lord!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,<br/>
Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
As the indifferent children of the earth.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;<br/>
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Nor the soles of her shoe?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Neither, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of<br/>
her favours?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
'Faith, her privates we.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she<br/>
is a strumpet. What's the news?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.<br/>
Let me question more in particular: what have you,<br/>
my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,<br/>
that she sends you to prison hither?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
Prison, my lord!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Denmark's a prison.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Then is the world one.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,<br/>
wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
We think not so, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing<br/>
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me<br/>
it is a prison.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too<br/>
narrow for your mind.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count<br/>
myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I<br/>
have bad dreams.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very<br/>
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
A dream itself is but a shadow.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a<br/>
quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.<br/>
</blockquote>

We'll wait upon you.<br/>

No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest<br/>
of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest<br/>

To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.<br/>

Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I<br/>
thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are<br/>
too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it<br/>
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,<br/>
deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
What should we say, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent<br/>
for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks<br/>
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:<br/>
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
To what end, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by<br/>
the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of<br/>
our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved<br/>
love, and by what more dear a better proposer could<br/>
charge you withal, be even and direct with me,<br/>
whether you were sent for, or no?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
[Aside to GUILDENSTERN]  What say you?<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
[Aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you<br/>
love me, hold not off.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, we were sent for.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation<br/>
prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king<br/>
and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but<br/>
wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all<br/>
custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily<br/>
with my disposition that this goodly frame, the<br/>
earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most<br/>
excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave<br/>
o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted<br/>
with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to<br/>
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.<br/>
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!<br/>
how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how<br/>
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!<br/>
in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the<br/>
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,<br/>
what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not<br/>
me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling<br/>
you seem to say so.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what<br/>
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from<br/>
you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they<br/>
coming, to offer you service.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty<br/>
shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight<br/>
shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not<br/>
sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part<br/>
in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose<br/>
lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall<br/>
say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt<br/>
for't. What players are they?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Even those you were wont to take delight in, the<br/>
tragedians of the city.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
How chances it they travel? their residence, both<br/>
in reputation and profit, was better both ways.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the<br/>
late innovation.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was<br/>
in the city? are they so followed?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
No, indeed, are they not.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
How comes it? do they grow rusty?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but<br/>
there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,<br/>
that cry out on the top of question, and are most<br/>
tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the<br/>
fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they<br/>
call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of<br/>
goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are<br/>
they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no<br/>
longer than they can sing? will they not say<br/>
afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common<br/>
players--as it is most like, if their means are no<br/>
better--their writers do them wrong, to make them<br/>
exclaim against their own succession?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and<br/>
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to<br/>
controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid<br/>
for argument, unless the poet and the player went to<br/>
cuffs in the question.<br/>

O, there has been much throwing about of brains.<br/>

Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.<br/>

It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of<br/>

lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,<br/>
must show fairly outward, should more appear like<br/>

Why,<br/>
'As by lot, God wot,'<br/>

<p><em>Enter four or five Players</em></p>
You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad<br/>
to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old<br/>
friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:<br/>
comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young<br/>
lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is<br/>
nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the<br/>
altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like<br/>
apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the<br/>
ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en<br/>
to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:<br/>
we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste<br/>
of your quality; come, a passionate speech.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Player</strong>
<blockquote>
What speech, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was<br/>
never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the<br/>
play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas<br/>
caviare to the general: but it was--as I received<br/>
it, and others, whose judgments in such matters<br/>
cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well<br/>
digested in the scenes, set down with as much<br/>
modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there<br/>
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter<br/>
savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might<br/>
indict the author of affectation; but called it an<br/>
honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very<br/>
much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I<br/>
chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and<br/>
thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of<br/>
Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin<br/>
at this line: let me see, let me see--<br/>
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--<br/>
it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--<br/>
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,<br/>
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble<br/>
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,<br/>
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd<br/>
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot<br/>
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd<br/>
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,<br/>
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,<br/>
That lend a tyrannous and damned light<br/>
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,<br/>
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,<br/>
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus<br/>
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'<br/>
So, proceed you.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and<br/>
good discretion.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Player</strong>
<blockquote>
'Anon he finds him<br/>
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,<br/>
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,<br/>
Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,<br/>
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;<br/>
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword<br/>
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,<br/>
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top<br/>
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash<br/>
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,<br/>
Which was declining on the milky head<br/>
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:<br/>
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,<br/>
And like a neutral to his will and matter,<br/>
Did nothing.<br/>
But, as we often see, against some storm,<br/>
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,<br/>
The bold winds speechless and the orb below<br/>
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder<br/>
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,<br/>
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;<br/>
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall<br/>
On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne<br/>
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword<br/>
Now falls on Priam.<br/>
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,<br/>
In general synod 'take away her power;<br/>
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,<br/>
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,<br/>
As low as to the fiends!'<br/>

'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames<br/>
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head<br/>
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,<br/>
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,<br/>
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;<br/>
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,<br/>
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have<br/>
pronounced:<br/>
But if the gods themselves did see her then<br/>
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport<br/>
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,<br/>
The instant burst of clamour that she made,<br/>
Unless things mortal move them not at all,<br/>
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,<br/>
And passion in the gods.'<br/>

Good my lord, will you see the players well<br/>

time: after your death you were better have a bad<br/>
epitaph than their ill report while you live.<br/>

Ay, so, God be wi' ye;<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
Now I am alone.<br/>
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!<br/>
Is it not monstrous that this player here,<br/>
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,<br/>
Could force his soul so to his own conceit<br/>
That from her working all his visage wann'd,<br/>
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,<br/>
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting<br/>
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!<br/>
For Hecuba!<br/>
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,<br/>
That he should weep for her? What would he do,<br/>
Had he the motive and the cue for passion<br/>
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears<br/>
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,<br/>
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,<br/>
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed<br/>
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,<br/>
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,<br/>
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,<br/>
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,<br/>
Upon whose property and most dear life<br/>
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?<br/>
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?<br/>
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?<br/>
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,<br/>
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?<br/>
Ha!<br/>
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be<br/>
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall<br/>
To make oppression bitter, or ere this<br/>
I should have fatted all the region kites<br/>
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!<br/>
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!<br/>
O, vengeance!<br/>
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,<br/>
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,<br/>
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,<br/>
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,<br/>
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,<br/>
A scullion!<br/>
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard<br/>
That guilty creatures sitting at a play<br/>
Have by the very cunning of the scene<br/>
Been struck so to the soul that presently<br/>
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;<br/>
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak<br/>
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players<br/>
Play something like the murder of my father<br/>
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;<br/>
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,<br/>
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen<br/>
May be the devil: and the devil hath power<br/>
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps<br/>
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,<br/>
As he is very potent with such spirits,<br/>
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds<br/>
More relative than this: the play 's the thing<br/>
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.<br/>

And can you, by no drift of circumstance,<br/>

Grating so harshly all his days of quiet<br/>

He does confess he feels himself distracted;<br/>
But from what cause he will by no means speak.<br/>

Niggard of question; but, of our demands,<br/>

And, as I think, they have already order<br/>
This night to play before him.<br/>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
'Tis most true:<br/>
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
To be, or not to be, that is the question,<br/>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br/>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br/>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br/>
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;<br/>
No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br/>
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br/>
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation<br/>
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;<br/>
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;<br/>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br/>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br/>
Must give us pause: there's the respect<br/>
That makes calamity of so long life;<br/>
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br/>
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br/>
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,<br/>
The insolence of office and the spurns<br/>
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br/>
When he himself might his quietus make<br/>
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br/>
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br/>
But that the dread of something after death,<br/>
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn<br/>
No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br/>
And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br/>
Than fly to others that we know not of?<br/>
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br/>
And thus the native hue of resolution<br/>
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br/>
And enterprises of great pith and moment<br/>
With this regard their currents turn awry,<br/>
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!<br/>
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons<br/>
Be all my sins remember'd.<br/>

My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;<br/>
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed<br/>
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,<br/>
Take these again; for to the noble mind<br/>
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.<br/>
There, my lord.<br/>

Ha, ha! are you honest?<br/>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>

My lord?<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Are you fair?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
What means your lordship?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should<br/>
admit no discourse to your beauty.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than<br/>
with honesty?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner<br/>
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the<br/>
force of honesty can translate beauty into his<br/>
likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the<br/>
time gives it proof. I did love you once.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot<br/>
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of<br/>
it: I loved you not.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
I was the more deceived.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a<br/>
breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;<br/>
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it<br/>
were better my mother had not borne me: I am very<br/>
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at<br/>
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,<br/>
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them<br/>
in. What should such fellows as I do crawling<br/>
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,<br/>
all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.<br/>
Where's your father?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
At home, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the<br/>
fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
O, help him, you sweet heavens!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for<br/>
thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as<br/>
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a<br/>
nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs<br/>
marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough<br/>
what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,<br/>
and quickly too. Farewell.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OPHELIA</strong>
<blockquote>
O heavenly powers, restore him!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God<br/>
has given you one face, and you make yourselves<br/>
another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and<br/>
nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness<br/>
your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath<br/>
made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:<br/>
those that are married already, all but one, shall<br/>
live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a<br/>

The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;<br/>

The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!<br/>
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,<br/>

Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,<br/>

From fashion of himself. What think you on't?<br/>

But, if you hold it fit, after the play<br/>
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him<br/>
To show his grief: let her be round with him;<br/>
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear<br/>
Of all their conference. If she find him not,<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to<br/>
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,<br/>
as many of your players do, I had as lief the<br/>
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air<br/>
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;<br/>
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,<br/>
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget<br/>
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it<br/>
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious<br/>
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to<br/>
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who<br/>
for the most part are capable of nothing but<br/>
inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such<br/>
a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it<br/>
out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Player</strong>
<blockquote>
I warrant your honour.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion<br/>
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the<br/>
word to the action; with this special o'erstep not<br/>
the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is<br/>
from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the<br/>
first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the<br/>
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,<br/>
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of<br/>
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,<br/>
or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful<br/>
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the<br/>
censure of the which one must in your allowance<br/>
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be<br/>
players that I have seen play, and heard others<br/>
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,<br/>
that, neither having the accent of Christians nor<br/>
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so<br/>
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of<br/>
nature's journeymen had made men and not made them<br/>
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.<br/>

<strong>First Player</strong>
<blockquote>
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,<br/>
sir.<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
O, reform it altogether. And let those that play<br/>
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;<br/>
for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to<br/>
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh<br/>
too; though, in the mean time, some necessary<br/>
question of the play be then to be considered:<br/>
that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition<br/>
in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>

                  Nay, do not think I flatter;<br/>
For what advancement may I hope from thee<br/>
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,<br/>
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?<br/>
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,<br/>
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee<br/>
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?<br/>
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice<br/>
And could of men distinguish, her election<br/>
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been<br/>
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,<br/>
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards<br/>
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those<br/>
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,<br/>
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger<br/>
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man<br/>
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him<br/>
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,<br/>
As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--<br/>
There is a play to-night before the king;<br/>
One scene of it comes near the circumstance<br/>
Which I have told thee of my father's death:<br/>
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,<br/>
Even with the very comment of thy soul<br/>
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt<br/>
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,<br/>
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,<br/>
And my imaginations are as foul<br/>
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;<br/>
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,<br/>
And after we will both our judgments join<br/>
In censure of his seeming.<br/>

   So many journeys may the sun and moon<br/>

But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,<br/>
So far from cheer and from your former state,<br/>
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,<br/>
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:<br/>
For women's fear and love holds quantity;<br/>
In neither aught, or in extremity.<br/>
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;<br/>
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:<br/>
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;<br/>
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.<br/>

<strong>Player King</strong>
<blockquote>
   I do believe you think what now you speak;<br/>
But what we do determine oft we break.<br/>
Purpose is but the slave to memory,<br/>
Of violent birth, but poor validity;<br/>
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;<br/>
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.<br/>
Most necessary 'tis that we forget<br/>

What to ourselves in passion we propose,<br/>

The violence of either grief or joy<br/>
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:<br/>
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;<br/>
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.<br/>
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange<br/>
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;<br/>
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,<br/>
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.<br/>
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;<br/>
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.<br/>
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;<br/>
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,<br/>
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,<br/>
Directly seasons him his enemy.<br/>
But, orderly to end where I begun,<br/>
Our wills and fates do so contrary run<br/>
That our devices still are overthrown;<br/>
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:<br/>
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;<br/>
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.<br/>

or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no<br/>
more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--<br/>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her<br/>
into amazement and admiration.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But<br/>
is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's<br/>
admiration? Impart.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you<br/>
go to bed.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have<br/>
you any further trade with us?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, you once did love me.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you<br/>
do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if<br/>
you deny your griefs to your friend.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Sir, I lack advancement.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king<br/>
himself for your succession in Denmark?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb<br/>
is something musty.<br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Players with recorders</em></p>
O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with<br/>
you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,<br/>
as if you would drive me into a toil?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too<br/>
unmannerly.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon<br/>
this pipe?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, I cannot.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I pray you.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>

Believe me, I cannot.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I do beseech you.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
I know no touch of it, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with<br/>
your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your<br/>
mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.<br/>
Look you, these are the stops.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
But these cannot I command to any utterance of<br/>
harmony; I have not the skill.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of<br/>
me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know<br/>
my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my<br/>
mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to<br/>
the top of my compass: and there is much music,<br/>
excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot<br/>
you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am<br/>
easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what<br/>
instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you<br/>
cannot play upon me.<br/>
<p><em>Enter POLONIUS</em></p>
God bless you, sir!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and<br/>
presently.<br/>

Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Methinks it is like a weasel.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
It is backed like a weasel.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Or like a whale?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Very like a whale.<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool<br/>
me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
I will say so.<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
By and by is easily said.<br/>
<p><em>Exit POLONIUS</em></p>
Leave me, friends.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but HAMLET</em></p>
Tis now the very witching time of night,<br/>
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out<br/>
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,<br/>
And do such bitter business as the day<br/>
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.<br/>
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever<br/>
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:<br/>
Let me be cruel, not unnatural:<br/>
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;<br/>
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;<br/>
How in my words soever she be shent,<br/>
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!<br/>

To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;<br/>
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,<br/>

Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow<br/>

The single and peculiar life is bound,<br/>
With all the strength and armour of the mind,<br/>
To keep itself from noyance; but much more<br/>
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest<br/>
The lives of many. The cease of majesty<br/>
Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw<br/>
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,<br/>
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,<br/>
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things<br/>
Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,<br/>
Each small annexment, petty consequence,<br/>
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone<br/>
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.<br/>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;<br/>
For we will fetters put upon this fear,<br/>

My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:<br/>
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,<br/>

And, as you said, and wisely was it said,<br/>
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,<br/>
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear<br/>
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:<br/>
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,<br/>

</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Thanks, dear my lord.<br/>
<p><em>Exit POLONIUS</em></p>
O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;<br/>
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,<br/>
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,<br/>
Though inclination be as sharp as will:<br/>
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;<br/>
And, like a man to double business bound,<br/>
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,<br/>
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand<br/>
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,<br/>
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens<br/>
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy<br/>
But to confront the visage of offence?<br/>
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,<br/>
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,<br/>
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;<br/>
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer<br/>
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?<br/>
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd<br/>
Of those effects for which I did the murder,<br/>
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.<br/>
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?<br/>
In the corrupted currents of this world<br/>
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,<br/>
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself<br/>
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;<br/>
There is no shuffling, there the action lies<br/>
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,<br/>
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,<br/>
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?<br/>
Try what repentance can: what can it not?<br/>
Yet what can it when one can not repent?<br/>
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!<br/>
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,<br/>
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!<br/>
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,<br/>
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!<br/>
All may be well.<br/>
<p><em>Retires and kneels</em></p>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;<br/>
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;<br/>
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:<br/>
A villain kills my father; and for that,<br/>
I, his sole son, do this same villain send<br/>
To heaven.<br/>
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.<br/>
He took my father grossly, full of bread;<br/>
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;<br/>
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?<br/>
But in our circumstance and course of thought,<br/>
'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,<br/>

When he is fit and season'd for his passage?<br/>
No!<br/>
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:<br/>
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,<br/>
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;<br/>
At gaming, swearing, or about some act<br/>
That has no relish of salvation in't;<br/>
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,<br/>
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black<br/>
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:<br/>
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.<br/>

</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue<br/>
In noise so rude against me?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Such an act<br/>
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,<br/>
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose<br/>
From the fair forehead of an innocent love<br/>
And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows<br/>
As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed<br/>
As from the body of contraction plucks<br/>
The very soul, and sweet religion makes<br/>
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:<br/>
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,<br/>
With tristful visage, as against the doom,<br/>
Is thought-sick at the act.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay me, what act,<br/>
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,<br/>
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.<br/>
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;<br/>
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;<br/>
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;<br/>
A station like the herald Mercury<br/>
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;<br/>
A combination and a form indeed,<br/>
Where every god did seem to set his seal,<br/>
To give the world assurance of a man:<br/>
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:<br/>
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,<br/>
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?<br/>
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,<br/>
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?<br/>
You cannot call it love; for at your age<br/>
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,<br/>
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment<br/>
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,<br/>
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense<br/>
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,<br/>
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd<br/>
But it reserved some quantity of choice,<br/>
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't<br/>
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?<br/>
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,<br/>
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,<br/>
Or but a sickly part of one true sense<br/>
Could not so mope.<br/>
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,<br/>
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,<br/>
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,<br/>
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame<br/>
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,<br/>
Since frost itself as actively doth burn<br/>
And reason panders will.<br/>

<blockquote>
O Hamlet, speak no more:<br/>
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;<br/>
And there I see such black and grained spots<br/>
As will not leave their tinct.<br/>

Nay, but to live<br/>
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,<br/>
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love<br/>
Over the nasty sty,--<br/>

O, speak to me no more;<br/>
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;<br/>
No more, sweet Hamlet!<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>

A murderer and a villain;<br/>
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe<br/>
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;<br/>

And put it in his pocket!<br/>

Do not forget: this visitation<br/>
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.<br/>

Speak to her, Hamlet.<br/>

How is it with you, lady?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
Alas, how is't with you,<br/>
That you do bend your eye on vacancy<br/>
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?<br/>
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;<br/>
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,<br/>
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,<br/>
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,<br/>
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper<br/>
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!<br/>
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,<br/>
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;<br/>
Lest with this piteous action you convert<br/>
My stern effects: then what I have to do<br/>
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
To whom do you speak this?<br/>

Do you see nothing there?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>

Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>

Nor did you nothing hear?<br/>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>

No, nothing but ourselves.<br/>
</blockquote>

Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!<br/>
My father, in his habit as he lived!<br/>
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!<br/>
<p><em>Exit Ghost</em></p>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
This the very coinage of your brain:<br/>
This bodiless creation ecstasy<br/>
Is very cunning in.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Ecstasy!<br/>
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,<br/>
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness<br/>
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,<br/>
And I the matter will re-word; which madness<br/>
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,<br/>
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,<br/>
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:<br/>
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,<br/>
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,<br/>
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;<br/>
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;<br/>
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,<br/>
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;<br/>
For in the fatness of these pursy times<br/>
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,<br/>
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
O, throw away the worser part of it,<br/>
And live the purer with the other half.<br/>
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;<br/>
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.<br/>
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,<br/>
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,<br/>
That to the use of actions fair and good<br/>
He likewise gives a frock or livery,<br/>
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,<br/>
And that shall lend a kind of easiness<br/>
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;<br/>
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,<br/>
And either [         ] the devil, or throw him out<br/>
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:<br/>
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,<br/>
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,<br/>
<p><em>Pointing to POLONIUS</em></p>
I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,<br/>
To punish me with this and this with me,<br/>
That I must be their scourge and minister.<br/>
I will bestow him, and will answer well<br/>
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.<br/>
I must be cruel, only to be kind:<br/>
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.<br/>
One word more, good lady.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
What shall I do?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:<br/>
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;<br/>
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;<br/>
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,<br/>
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,<br/>
Make you to ravel all this matter out,<br/>
That I essentially am not in madness,<br/>
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;<br/>
For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,<br/>
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,<br/>
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?<br/>
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,<br/>
Unpeg the basket on the house's top.<br/>
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,<br/>
To try conclusions, in the basket creep,<br/>
And break your own neck down.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,<br/>
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe<br/>
What thou hast said to me.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I must to England; you know that?<br/>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,<br/>
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,<br/>
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,<br/>
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;<br/>
For 'tis the sport to have the engineer<br/>
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard<br/>
But I will delve one yard below their mines,<br/>
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,<br/>
When in one line two crafts directly meet.<br/>
This man shall set me packing:<br/>
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.<br/>
Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor<br/>

Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,<br/>

Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body<br/>
Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;<br/>

<h3>SCENE II. Another room in the castle.</h3>

<em>Enter HAMLET</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Safely stowed.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ:</strong>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN:</strong>
<blockquote>
[Within]  Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
What noise? who calls on Hamlet?<br/>
O, here they come.<br/>
<p><em>Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence<br/>
And bear it to the chapel.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Do not believe it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Believe what?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.<br/>
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what<br/>
replication should be made by the son of a king?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his<br/>
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the<br/>
king best service in the end: he keeps them, like<br/>
an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to<br/>
be last swallowed: when he needs what you have<br/>
gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you<br/>
shall be dry again.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
I understand you not, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a<br/>
foolish ear.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go<br/>
with us to the king.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
The body is with the king, but the king is not with<br/>
the body. The king is a thing--<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong>
<blockquote>
A thing, my lord!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>SCENE III. Another room in the castle.</h3>
<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.<br/>
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!<br/>
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:<br/>
He's loved of the distracted multitude,<br/>
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;<br/>
And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,<br/>
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,<br/>
This sudden sending him away must seem<br/>
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown<br/>
By desperate appliance are relieved,<br/>
Or not at all.<br/>
<p><em>Enter ROSENCRANTZ</em></p>
How now! what hath befall'n?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,<br/>
We cannot get from him.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
But where is he?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Bring him before us.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.<br/>
<p><em>Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
At supper.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
At supper! where?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain<br/>
convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your<br/>
worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all<br/>
creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for<br/>
maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but<br/>
variable service, two dishes, but to one table:<br/>
that's the end.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Alas, alas!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a<br/>
king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
What dost you mean by this?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a<br/>
progress through the guts of a beggar.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Where is Polonius?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger<br/>
find him not there, seek him i' the other place<br/>
yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within<br/>
this month, you shall nose him as you go up the<br/>
stairs into the lobby.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Go seek him there.<br/>
<p><em>To some Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
He will stay till ye come.<br/>

</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--<br/>
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve<br/>
For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence<br/>
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;<br/>
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,<br/>
The associates tend, and every thing is bent<br/>
For England.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
                  For England!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, Hamlet.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Good.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for<br/>
England! Farewell, dear mother.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Thy loving father, Hamlet.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man<br/>
and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!<br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;<br/>
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:<br/>
Away! for every thing is seal'd and done<br/>
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--<br/>
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,<br/>
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red<br/>
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe<br/>
Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set<br/>
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,<br/>
By letters congruing to that effect,<br/>
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;<br/>
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,<br/>
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,<br/>
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.<br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;<br/>
Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras<br/>
Craves the conveyance of a promised march<br/>
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.<br/>
If that his majesty would aught with us,<br/>
We shall express our duty in his eye;<br/>
And let him know so.<br/>

Good sir, whose powers are these?<br/>

They are of Norway, sir.<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
How purposed, sir, I pray you?<br/>

<blockquote>
Against some part of Poland.<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Who commands them, sir?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Captain</strong>
<blockquote>
The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,<br/>
Or for some frontier?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Captain</strong>
<blockquote>
Truly to speak, and with no addition,<br/>
We go to gain a little patch of ground<br/>
That hath in it no profit but the name.<br/>
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;<br/>
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole<br/>
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Captain</strong>
<blockquote>
Yes, it is already garrison'd.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats<br/>
Will not debate the question of this straw:<br/>
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,<br/>
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without<br/>
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Captain</strong>
<blockquote>
God be wi' you, sir.<br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong>
<blockquote>
Wilt please you go, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I'll be with you straight go a little before.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all except HAMLET</em></p>
How all occasions do inform against me,<br/>
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,<br/>
If his chief good and market of his time<br/>
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.<br/>
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,<br/>
Looking before and after, gave us not<br/>
That capability and god-like reason<br/>
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be<br/>
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple<br/>
Of thinking too precisely on the event,<br/>
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom<br/>
And ever three parts coward, I do not know<br/>
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'<br/>
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means<br/>
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:<br/>
Witness this army of such mass and charge<br/>
Led by a delicate and tender prince,<br/>
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd<br/>
Makes mouths at the invisible event,<br/>
Exposing what is mortal and unsure<br/>
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,<br/>
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great<br/>
Is not to stir without great argument,<br/>
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw<br/>
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,<br/>
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,<br/>
Excitements of my reason and my blood,<br/>
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see<br/>
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,<br/>
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,<br/>
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot<br/>
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,<br/>
Which is not tomb enough and continent<br/>
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,<br/>
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!<br/>

<strong>Gentleman</strong>
<blockquote>
She is importunate, indeed distract:<br/>
Her mood will needs be pitied.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
What would she have?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Gentleman</strong>
<blockquote>
She speaks much of her father; says she hears<br/>
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;<br/>
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,<br/>
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,<br/>
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move<br/>
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,<br/>
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;<br/>
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures<br/>
yield them,<br/>
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,<br/>
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>

'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew<br/>
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.<br/>

<blockquote>
Let her come in.<br/>
<p><em>Exit HORATIO</em></p>
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,<br/>

So full of artless jealousy is guilt,<br/>
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.<br/>

O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs<br/>
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,<br/>
When sorrows come, they come not single spies<br/>
But in battalions. First, her father slain:<br/>
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author<br/>
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,<br/>
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,<br/>
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,<br/>
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia<br/>
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,<br/>
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:<br/>
Last, and as much containing as all these,<br/>
Her brother is in secret come from France;<br/>
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,<br/>
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear<br/>
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;<br/>
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,<br/>
Will nothing stick our person to arraign<br/>
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,<br/>
Like to a murdering-piece, in many places<br/>
Gives me superfluous death.<br/>

The ocean, overpeering of his list,<br/>
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste<br/>
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,<br/>
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;<br/>
And, as the world were now but to begin,<br/>
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,<br/>
The ratifiers and props of every word,<br/>

<p><em>Enter Sailors</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Sailor</strong>
<blockquote>
God bless you, sir.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Let him bless thee too.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Sailor</strong>
<blockquote>
He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for<br/>
you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was<br/>
bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am<br/>
let to know it is.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
[Reads]  'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked<br/>
this, give these fellows some means to the king:<br/>
they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old<br/>
at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us<br/>
chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on<br/>
a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded<br/>
them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so<br/>
I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with<br/>
me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they<br/>
did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king<br/>
have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me<br/>
with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I<br/>
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee<br/>
dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of<br/>
the matter. These good fellows will bring thee<br/>
where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their<br/>
course for England: of them I have much to tell<br/>
thee. Farewell.<br/>
'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'<br/>
Come, I will make you way for these your letters;<br/>
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me<br/>
To him from whom you brought them.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h3>SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.</h3>
<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,<br/>
And you must put me in your heart for friend,<br/>
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,<br/>
That he which hath your noble father slain<br/>
Pursued my life.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
                  It well appears: but tell me<br/>
Why you proceeded not against these feats,<br/>
So crimeful and so capital in nature,<br/>
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,<br/>
You mainly were stirr'd up.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
O, for two special reasons;<br/>
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,<br/>
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother<br/>
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--<br/>
My virtue or my plague, be it either which--<br/>
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,<br/>
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,<br/>
I could not but by her. The other motive,<br/>
Why to a public count I might not go,<br/>
Is the great love the general gender bear him;<br/>
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,<br/>
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,<br/>
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,<br/>
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,<br/>
Would have reverted to my bow again,<br/>
And not where I had aim'd them.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
And so have I a noble father lost;<br/>
A sister driven into desperate terms,<br/>
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,<br/>
Stood challenger on mount of all the age<br/>
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think<br/>
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull<br/>
That we can let our beard be shook with danger<br/>
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:<br/>
I loved your father, and we love ourself;<br/>
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--<br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
How now! what news?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Messenger</strong>
<blockquote>
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:<br/>
This to your majesty; this to the queen.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
From Hamlet! who brought them?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Messenger</strong>
<blockquote>
Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:<br/>
They were given me by Claudio; he received them<br/>
Of him that brought them.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.<br/>
<p><em>Exit Messenger</em></p>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on<br/>
your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see<br/>
your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your<br/>
pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden<br/>
and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'<br/>
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?<br/>
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Know you the hand?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!<br/>
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'<br/>
Can you advise me?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;<br/>
It warms the very sickness in my heart,<br/>
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,<br/>
'Thus didest thou.'<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
If it be so, Laertes--<br/>
As how should it be so? how otherwise?--<br/>
Will you be ruled by me?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, my lord;<br/>
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,<br/>
As checking at his voyage, and that he means<br/>
No more to undertake it, I will work him<br/>
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,<br/>
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:<br/>
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,<br/>
But even his mother shall uncharge the practise<br/>
And call it accident.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, I will be ruled;<br/>
The rather, if you could devise it so<br/>
That I might be the organ.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
It falls right.<br/>
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,<br/>
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality<br/>
Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts<br/>
Did not together pluck such envy from him<br/>
As did that one, and that, in my regard,<br/>
Of the unworthiest siege.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
What part is that, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
A very riband in the cap of youth,<br/>
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes<br/>
The light and careless livery that it wears<br/>
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,<br/>
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,<br/>
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--<br/>
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,<br/>
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant<br/>
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;<br/>
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,<br/>
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured<br/>
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,<br/>
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,<br/>
Come short of what he did.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
A Norman was't?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
A Norman.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Upon my life, Lamond.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
The very same.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
I know him well: he is the brooch indeed<br/>
And gem of all the nation.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
He made confession of you,<br/>
And gave you such a masterly report<br/>
For art and exercise in your defence<br/>
And for your rapier most especially,<br/>
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,<br/>
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,<br/>
He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,<br/>
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his<br/>
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy<br/>
That he could nothing do but wish and beg<br/>
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.<br/>
Now, out of this,--<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
What out of this, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Laertes, was your father dear to you?<br/>
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,<br/>
A face without a heart?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Why ask you this?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Not that I think you did not love your father;<br/>
But that I know love is begun by time;<br/>
And that I see, in passages of proof,<br/>
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.<br/>
There lives within the very flame of love<br/>
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;<br/>
And nothing is at a like goodness still;<br/>
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,<br/>
Dies in his own too much: that we would do<br/>
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes<br/>
And hath abatements and delays as many<br/>
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;<br/>
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,<br/>
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--<br/>
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,<br/>
To show yourself your father's son in deed<br/>
More than in words?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
To cut his throat i' the church.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;<br/>
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,<br/>
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.<br/>
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:<br/>
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence<br/>
And set a double varnish on the fame<br/>
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together<br/>
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,<br/>
Most generous and free from all contriving,<br/>
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,<br/>
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose<br/>
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise<br/>
Requite him for your father.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
I will do't:<br/>
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.<br/>
I bought an unction of a mountebank,<br/>
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,<br/>
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,<br/>
Collected from all simples that have virtue<br/>
Under the moon, can save the thing from death<br/>
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point<br/>
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,<br/>
It may be death.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
                  Let's further think of this;<br/>
Weigh what convenience both of time and means<br/>
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,<br/>
And that our drift look through our bad performance,<br/>
'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project<br/>
Should have a back or second, that might hold,<br/>
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:<br/>
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.<br/>
When in your motion you are hot and dry--<br/>
As make your bouts more violent to that end--<br/>
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him<br/>
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,<br/>
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,<br/>
Our purpose may hold there.<br/>
<p><em>Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE</em></p>
How now, sweet queen!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,<br/>
So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Drown'd! O, where?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,<br/>
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;<br/>
There with fantastic garlands did she come<br/>
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples<br/>
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,<br/>
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:<br/>
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds<br/>
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;<br/>
When down her weedy trophies and herself<br/>
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;<br/>
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:<br/>
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;<br/>
As one incapable of her own distress,<br/>
Or like a creature native and indued<br/>
Unto that element: but long it could not be<br/>
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,<br/>
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay<br/>
To muddy death.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
                  Alas, then, she is drown'd?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
Drown'd, drown'd.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,<br/>
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet<br/>
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,<br/>
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,<br/>
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:<br/>
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,<br/>
But that this folly douts it.<br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Let's follow, Gertrude:<br/>
How much I had to do to calm his rage!<br/>
Now fear I this will give it start again;<br/>
Therefore let's follow.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h3>ACT V</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. A churchyard.</h3>
<blockquote>
<em>Enter two Clowns, with spades,  &amp; c</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that<br/>
wilfully seeks her own salvation?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Second Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave<br/>
straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it<br/>
Christian burial.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her<br/>
own defence?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Second Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, 'tis found so.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For<br/>
here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,<br/>
it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it<br/>
is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned<br/>
herself wittingly.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Second Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here<br/>
stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,<br/>
and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he<br/>
goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him<br/>
and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he<br/>
that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Second Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
But is this law?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Second Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been<br/>
a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'<br/>
Christian burial.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that<br/>
great folk should have countenance in this world to<br/>
drown or hang themselves, more than their even<br/>
Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient<br/>
gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:<br/>
they hold up Adam's profession.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Second Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Was he a gentleman?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
He was the first that ever bore arms.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Second Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, he had none.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the<br/>
Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'<br/>
could he dig without arms? I'll put another<br/>
question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the<br/>
purpose, confess thyself--<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Second Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Go to.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
What is he that builds stronger than either the<br/>
mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Second Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a<br/>
thousand tenants.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows<br/>
does well; but how does it well? it does well to<br/>
those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the<br/>
gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,<br/>
the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Second Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or<br/>
a carpenter?'<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Second Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Marry, now I can tell.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
To't.<br/>

<strong>Second Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Mass, I cannot tell.<br/>
<p><em>Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance</em></p>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull<br/>
ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when<br/>
you are asked this question next, say 'a<br/>
grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till<br/>
doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a<br/>
stoup of liquor.<br/>
<p><em>Exit Second Clown</em></p>
<p><em>He digs and sings</em></p>
In youth, when I did love, did love,<br/>
Methought it was very sweet,<br/>
To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,<br/>
O, methought, there was nothing meet.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he<br/>
sings at grave-making?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath<br/>
the daintier sense.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
[Sings]<br/>
But age, with his stealing steps,<br/>
Hath claw'd me in his clutch,<br/>
And hath shipped me intil the land,<br/>
As if I had never been such.<br/>
<p><em>Throws up a skull</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:<br/>
how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were<br/>
Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It<br/>
might be the pate of a politician, which this ass<br/>
now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,<br/>
might it not?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
It might, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,<br/>
sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might<br/>
be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord<br/>
such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and<br/>
knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:<br/>
here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to<br/>
see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,<br/>
but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
[Sings]<br/>
A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,<br/>
For and a shrouding sheet:<br/>
O, a pit of clay for to be made<br/>
For such a guest is meet.<br/>
<p><em>Throws up another skull</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a<br/>
lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,<br/>
his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he<br/>
suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the<br/>
sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of<br/>
his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be<br/>
in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,<br/>
his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,<br/>
his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and<br/>
the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine<br/>
pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him<br/>
no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than<br/>
the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The<br/>
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in<br/>
this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Not a jot more, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance<br/>
in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose<br/>
grave's this, sirrah?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Mine, sir.<br/>
<p><em>Sings</em></p>
O, a pit of clay for to be made<br/>
For such a guest is meet.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not<br/>
yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:<br/>
'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to<br/>
you.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
What man dost thou dig it for?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
For no man, sir.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
What woman, then?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
For none, neither.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Who is to be buried in't?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the<br/>
card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,<br/>
Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of<br/>
it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the<br/>
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he<br/>
gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a<br/>
grave-maker?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day<br/>
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
How long is that since?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it<br/>
was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that<br/>
is mad, and sent into England.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits<br/>
there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Why?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men<br/>
are as mad as he.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
How came he mad?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Very strangely, they say.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
How strangely?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Upon what ground?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man<br/>
and boy, thirty years.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we<br/>
have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce<br/>
hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year<br/>
or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Why he more than another?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that<br/>
he will keep out water a great while; and your water<br/>
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.<br/>
Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth<br/>
three and twenty years.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Whose was it?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Nay, I know not.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a<br/>
flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,<br/>
sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
This?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Clown</strong>
<blockquote>
E'en that.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Let me see.<br/>
<p><em>Takes the skull</em></p>
Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow<br/>
of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath<br/>
borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how<br/>
abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at<br/>
it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know<br/>
not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your<br/>
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,<br/>
that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one<br/>
now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?<br/>
Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let<br/>
her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must<br/>
come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell<br/>
me one thing.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
What's that, my lord?<br/>

E'en so, my lord.<br/>

To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may<br/>
not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,<br/>
till he find it stopping a bung-hole?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with<br/>
modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as<br/>
thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,<br/>
Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of<br/>
earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he<br/>
was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?<br/>
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,<br/>
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:<br/>
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,<br/>
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!<br/>
But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.<br/>
<p><em>Enter Priest,  &amp; c. in procession; the Corpse of  OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains,  &amp; c</em></p>
The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?<br/>
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken<br/>
The corse they follow did with desperate hand<br/>
Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.<br/>
Couch we awhile, and mark.<br/>
<p><em>Retiring with HORATIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
What ceremony else?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
That is Laertes,<br/>
A very noble youth: mark.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
What ceremony else?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Priest</strong>
<blockquote>
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged<br/>
As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;<br/>
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,<br/>
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged<br/>
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,<br/>
Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;<br/>
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,<br/>
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home<br/>
Of bell and burial.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Must there no more be done?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Priest</strong>
<blockquote>
No more be done:<br/>
We should profane the service of the dead<br/>
To sing a requiem and such rest to her<br/>
As to peace-parted souls.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Lay her i' the earth:<br/>
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh<br/>
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,<br/>
A ministering angel shall my sister be,<br/>
When thou liest howling.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
What, the fair Ophelia!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!<br/>
<p><em>Scattering flowers</em></p>
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;<br/>
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,<br/>
And not have strew'd thy grave.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
O, treble woe<br/>
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,<br/>
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense<br/>
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,<br/>
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:<br/>
<p><em>Leaps into the grave</em></p>
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,<br/>
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,<br/>
To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head<br/>
Of blue Olympus.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
[Advancing]     What is he whose grief<br/>
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow<br/>
Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand<br/>
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,<br/>
Hamlet the Dane.<br/>
<p><em>Leaps into the grave</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
                  The devil take thy soul!<br/>
<p><em>Grappling with him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Thou pray'st not well.<br/>
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;<br/>
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,<br/>
Yet have I something in me dangerous,<br/>
Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.<br/>

                  Good my lord, be quiet.<br/>
<p><em>The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Why I will fight with him upon this theme<br/>
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
O my son, what theme?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers<br/>
Could not, with all their quantity of love,<br/>
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
O, he is mad, Laertes.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
For love of God, forbear him.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:<br/>
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?<br/>
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?<br/>
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?<br/>
To outface me with leaping in her grave?<br/>
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:<br/>
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw<br/>
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,<br/>
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,<br/>
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,<br/>
I'll rant as well as thou.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
This is mere madness:<br/>
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;<br/>
Anon, as patient as the female dove,<br/>
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,<br/>
His silence will sit drooping.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Hear you, sir;<br/>
What is the reason that you use me thus?<br/>
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;<br/>
Let Hercules himself do what he may,<br/>
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.<br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.<br/>
<p><em>Exit HORATIO</em></p>
<p><em>To LAERTES</em></p>
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;<br/>
We'll put the matter to the present push.<br/>
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.<br/>
This grave shall have a living monument:<br/>
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;<br/>
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.<br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>SCENE II. A hall in the castle.</h3>
<blockquote>
<em>Enter HAMLET and HORATIO</em>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;<br/>
You do remember all the circumstance?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Remember it, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,<br/>
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay<br/>
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,<br/>
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,<br/>
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,<br/>
When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us<br/>
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,<br/>
Rough-hew them how we will,--<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
That is most certain.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Up from my cabin,<br/>
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark<br/>
Groped I to find out them; had my desire.<br/>
Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew<br/>
To mine own room again; making so bold,<br/>
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal<br/>
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--<br/>
O royal knavery!--an exact command,<br/>
Larded with many several sorts of reasons<br/>
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,<br/>
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,<br/>
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,<br/>
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,<br/>
My head should be struck off.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Is't possible?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.<br/>
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
I beseech you.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--<br/>
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,<br/>
They had begun the play--I sat me down,<br/>
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:<br/>
I once did hold it, as our statists do,<br/>
A baseness to write fair and labour'd much<br/>
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now<br/>
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know<br/>
The effect of what I wrote?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Ay, good my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
An earnest conjuration from the king,<br/>
As England was his faithful tributary,<br/>
As love between them like the palm might flourish,<br/>
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear<br/>
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,<br/>
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,<br/>
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,<br/>
Without debatement further, more or less,<br/>
He should the bearers put to sudden death,<br/>
Not shriving-time allow'd.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
How was this seal'd?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.<br/>
I had my father's signet in my purse,<br/>
Which was the model of that Danish seal;<br/>
Folded the writ up in form of the other,<br/>
Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,<br/>
The changeling never known. Now, the next day<br/>
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent<br/>
Thou know'st already.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;<br/>
They are not near my conscience; their defeat<br/>
Does by their own insinuation grow:<br/>
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes<br/>
Between the pass and fell incensed points<br/>
Of mighty opposites.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, what a king is this!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--<br/>
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,<br/>
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,<br/>
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,<br/>
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,<br/>
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,<br/>
To let this canker of our nature come<br/>
In further evil?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
It must be shortly known to him from England<br/>
What is the issue of the business there.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
It will be short: the interim is mine;<br/>
And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'<br/>
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,<br/>
That to Laertes I forgot myself;<br/>
For, by the image of my cause, I see<br/>
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.<br/>
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me<br/>
Into a towering passion.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Peace! who comes here?<br/>
<p><em>Enter OSRIC</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
No, my good lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to<br/>
know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a<br/>
beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at<br/>
the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,<br/>
spacious in the possession of dirt.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I<br/>
should impart a thing to you from his majesty.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of<br/>
spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is<br/>
northerly.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my<br/>
complexion.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as<br/>
'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his<br/>
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a<br/>
great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I beseech you, remember--<br/>
<p><em>HAMLET moves him to put on his hat</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.<br/>
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe<br/>
me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent<br/>
differences, of very soft society and great showing:<br/>
indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or<br/>
calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the<br/>
continent of what part a gentleman would see.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;<br/>
though, I know, to divide him inventorially would<br/>
dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw<br/>
neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the<br/>
verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of<br/>
great article; and his infusion of such dearth and<br/>
rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his<br/>
semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace<br/>
him, his umbrage, nothing more.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman<br/>
in our more rawer breath?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
Sir?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?<br/>
You will do't, sir, really.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
Of Laertes?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Of him, sir.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
I know you are not ignorant--<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,<br/>
it would not much approve me. Well, sir?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with<br/>
him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to<br/>
know himself.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation<br/>
laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
What's his weapon?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
Rapier and dagger.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
That's two of his weapons: but, well.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary<br/>
horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take<br/>
it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their<br/>
assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the<br/>
carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very<br/>
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,<br/>
and of very liberal conceit.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
What call you the carriages?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we<br/>
could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might<br/>
be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses<br/>
against six French swords, their assigns, and three<br/>
liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet<br/>
against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes<br/>
between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you<br/>
three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it<br/>
would come to immediate trial, if your lordship<br/>
would vouchsafe the answer.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
How if I answer 'no'?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his<br/>
majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let<br/>
the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the<br/>
king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;<br/>
if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
I commend my duty to your lordship.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Yours, yours.<br/>
<p><em>Exit OSRIC</em></p>
He does well to commend it himself; there are no<br/>
tongues else for's turn.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.<br/>
Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I<br/>
know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of<br/>
the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of<br/>
yesty collection, which carries them through and<br/>
through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do<br/>
but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.<br/>
<p><em>Enter a Lord</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>Lord</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young<br/>
Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in<br/>
the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to<br/>
play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's<br/>
pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now<br/>
or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Lord</strong>
<blockquote>
The king and queen and all are coming down.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
In happy time.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>Lord</strong>
<blockquote>
The queen desires you to use some gentle<br/>
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
She well instructs me.<br/>
<p><em>Exit Lord</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
You will lose this wager, my lord.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I do not think so: since he went into France, I<br/>
have been in continual practise: I shall win at the<br/>
odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here<br/>
about my heart: but it is no matter.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Nay, good my lord,--<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of<br/>
gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will<br/>
forestall their repair hither, and say you are not<br/>
fit.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special<br/>
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,<br/>
'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be<br/>
now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the<br/>
readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he<br/>
leaves, what is't to leave betimes?<br/>
<p><em>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils,  &amp; c</em></p>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.<br/>
<p><em>KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;<br/>
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.<br/>
This presence knows,<br/>
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd<br/>
With sore distraction. What I have done,<br/>
That might your nature, honour and exception<br/>
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.<br/>
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:<br/>
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,<br/>
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,<br/>
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.<br/>
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,<br/>
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;<br/>
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.<br/>
Sir, in this audience,<br/>
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil<br/>
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,<br/>
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,<br/>
And hurt my brother.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
I am satisfied in nature,<br/>
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most<br/>
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour<br/>
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,<br/>
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,<br/>
I have a voice and precedent of peace,<br/>
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,<br/>
I do receive your offer'd love like love,<br/>
And will not wrong it.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I embrace it freely;<br/>
And will this brother's wager frankly play.<br/>
Give us the foils. Come on.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Come, one for me.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance<br/>
Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,<br/>
Stick fiery off indeed.<br/>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
You mock me, sir.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
No, by this hand.<br/>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,<br/>
You know the wager?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Very well, my lord<br/>
Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:<br/>
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
This is too heavy, let me see another.<br/>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?<br/>

Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.<br/>

Or quit in answer of the third exchange,<br/>
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:<br/>

And in the cup an union shall he throw,<br/>
Richer than that which four successive kings<br/>
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;<br/>
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,<br/>
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,<br/>
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,<br/>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
My lord, I'll hit him now.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
I do not think't.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
[Aside]  And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;<br/>
I pray you, pass with your best violence;<br/>
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Say you so? come on.<br/>
<p><em>They play</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
Nothing, neither way.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Have at you now!<br/>
<p><em>LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
Part them; they are incensed.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Nay, come, again.<br/>
<p><em>QUEEN GERTRUDE falls</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
                  Look to the queen there, ho!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
How is't, Laertes?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;<br/>
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
How does the queen?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
She swounds to see them bleed.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong>
<blockquote>
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--<br/>
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.<br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:<br/>
Treachery! Seek it out.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;<br/>
No medicine in the world can do thee good;<br/>
In thee there is not half an hour of life;<br/>
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,<br/>
Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise<br/>
Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,<br/>
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:<br/>
I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
The point!--envenom'd too!<br/>
Then, venom, to thy work.<br/>
<p><em>Stabs KING CLAUDIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>All</strong>
<blockquote>
Treason! treason!<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong>
<blockquote>
O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,<br/>
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?<br/>
Follow my mother.<br/>
<p><em>KING CLAUDIUS dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>LAERTES</strong>
<blockquote>
                  He is justly served;<br/>
It is a poison temper'd by himself.<br/>
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:<br/>
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,<br/>
Nor thine on me.<br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.<br/>
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!<br/>
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,<br/>
That are but mutes or audience to this act,<br/>
Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,<br/>
Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--<br/>
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;<br/>
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright<br/>
To the unsatisfied.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Never believe it:<br/>
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:<br/>
Here's yet some liquor left.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
As thou'rt a man,<br/>
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.<br/>
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,<br/>
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!<br/>
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart<br/>
Absent thee from felicity awhile,<br/>
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,<br/>
To tell my story.<br/>
<p><em>March afar off, and shot within</em></p>
What warlike noise is this?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>OSRIC</strong>
<blockquote>
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,<br/>
To the ambassadors of England gives<br/>
This warlike volley.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HAMLET</strong>
<blockquote>
O, I die, Horatio;<br/>
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:<br/>
I cannot live to hear the news from England;<br/>
But I do prophesy the election lights<br/>
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;<br/>
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,<br/>
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.<br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:<br/>
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!<br/>
Why does the drum come hither?<br/>
<p><em>March within</em></p>
<p><em>Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<strong>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</strong>
<blockquote>
Where is this sight?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
What is it ye would see?<br/>
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</strong>
<blockquote>
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,<br/>
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,<br/>
That thou so many princes at a shot<br/>
So bloodily hast struck?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>First Ambassador</strong>
<blockquote>
The sight is dismal;<br/>
And our affairs from England come too late:<br/>
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,<br/>
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,<br/>
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:<br/>
Where should we have our thanks?<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Not from his mouth,<br/>
Had it the ability of life to thank you:<br/>
He never gave commandment for their death.<br/>
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,<br/>
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,<br/>
Are here arrived give order that these bodies<br/>
High on a stage be placed to the view;<br/>
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world<br/>
How these things came about: so shall you hear<br/>
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,<br/>
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,<br/>
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,<br/>
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook<br/>
Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I<br/>
Truly deliver.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</strong>
<blockquote>
                  Let us haste to hear it,<br/>
And call the noblest to the audience.<br/>
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:<br/>
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,<br/>
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>HORATIO</strong>
<blockquote>
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,<br/>
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;<br/>
But let this same be presently perform'd,<br/>
Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance<br/>
On plots and errors, happen.<br/>
</blockquote>

<strong>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</strong>
<blockquote>
Let four captains<br/>
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;<br/>
For he was likely, had he been put on,<br/>
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,<br/>
The soldiers' music and the rites of war<br/>
Speak loudly for him.<br/>
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this<br/>
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.<br/>
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.<br/>
</blockquote>
<p><em>A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off</em></p>
